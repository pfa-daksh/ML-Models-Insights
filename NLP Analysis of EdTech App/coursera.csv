0,Amazing app yet.. There is a problem with the ID verification.. I can't find a permission to the camera in the app. Please try to fix it
1,Worst experience
2,My babies for life jare.....helping people and saving lives...you deserve more than a 5star rating
3,My University in the phone. I love it
4,Love the application
5,Russophobia
6,No demo video and High free Udemy also better than you. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüõ¢Ô∏èüòè‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
7,Nice app....the financial aid works well I am happy to engage my time here.
8,Thanks so much for crearing this app And thanks for creating exceptional learning for those that aren't financially stable
9,Not sure what's wrong with this. Ideally all the apps on Android stops playing the moment you lock your screen. This app continue to play without showing any progress bar or popup. It's really frustrating.
10,We're on 2022 but this application yet to support drak mode! Till now I'm still using the website and I'll continue to do so unless dark mode has been implemented
11,"Unable to verify ID from past 3 months!!! Neither getting any support from help center, just closing the case with the instruction."
12,Amazing üëè
13,"Getting an error that app can't refresh data. Uninstalled, reinstalled and got the same error. I love this app, hoping a fix is identified."
14,Exceptional
15,Please dont fall for their cheating. I have paid 3000 rs for their data science course and unable to complete the course and receive certificate.they are asking for extra money to complete the course. I have emailed and no reply from there side.Fraud
16,Excellent
17,"Seems great until it's not, hard to find solutions to problems"
18,"I have completed a course but still i am not able to download the certificate, it is still showing verify ID. Don't play such scams people trust on you."
19,This new version is way too Poor.... I can't download videos anymore. Why is that??
20,I recommend multiple install for example to have an app on the phone at the same time on my PC using the same account detail.
21,Downloaded readings are saved without pictures. It is a major issue as I mostly use this app on commute. Also the picture quality isn't enough sometimes.
22,"On multiple choice questions sometimes my answers aren't logged. Retook a test and answered a question I got correct previously. After submitting it, the answers I marked were not shown and was counted as incorrect. This has happened on multiple tests causing my scores to be lowered."
23,Worst service ... I had paid for Google data analytics course ‚Çπ2089/- and made account accordingly as instructed but in my purchase it shows no course fees is been paid...had mailed at help center.... No one responded yet... It's fraud.... Worst service... Worst app.... Disappointed .... It's a scam.... Beware
24,Very good app for learning. Everyone must download this app.
25,Downloads not working as of 22/03/2022
26,Picture of enrolled course and their text content is not loading in the My Courses tab. No option to download entire courses at once. Lags a lot. App takes forever to load. The android app does not recognise the progress I make in the web version of Coursera I.e Coursera Android and Coursera Web are not in sync. Tapping on settings button shows a blank screen. My Courses tab never loads or takes ages to load. Inspite of entering a properly spaced name the app is not entering my properly spaced n
27,The best platform ever
28,"What is the verification id and how can I get it ? , please help."
29,Account verification...I verified my account with my Id.the name verified isn't even closed to the name on the ID and it was written on my certificate.please this isn't my name fix it ..you just murdered my name
30,Please add Nots and reading material in Urdu language ...which helps many students .. Thanks
31,Learning has never been so great than this...i love this app even though it forces me to use a desktop for some assignments....
32,Nice app
33,Thanks For Building this thing !üòÄüòÄ
34,Perfect
35,Great
36,Still the best education app.
37,"There is no section on the course page where prerequisites and corequisites are mentioned..... I had to drop out of two courses I enrolled in because they were too advanced. Please add such section. Also add a Black theme for utilising the AMOLED screen in the best way. It's a must have feature in 2022 (even the Dark theme isn't available, have low hopes for Black theme). Other than that, everything is awesome. Perhaps it is better than any other MOOC platforms out there in my opinion."
38,My refund is not received and the support team is not responding correct where the is the chat option...
39,Wow
40,assignment discussion not loading ... can you help me please
41,BLAST!!!! Best online learning platform
42,No dark theme. I'll give 5 stars if a dark theme is added.
43,Great courses- but dreadful indexing and search engine prevents you from finding them! I've spent a day trying to find Russian language courses. Filters are not explained. If I select 'Russian language' is that the language of delivery or the topic?
44,"It says free courses, it will tell you the courses are offered for free but nothing is free. Just because you can look at course materials doesn't mean anything to someone who believes it is free. You need to take the word free off the site, and out of the programs listed. If you actually offered free courses I might have been prompted to do more and pay for a few programs. But since financial aid is required for a free course, so no thanks. What I've said is Free. Your Welcome"
45,"I'm having trouble using the app. The app background is dark grey and the font is black. So I have to turn my brightness to the full to be able to even read. When scrolling, the text randomly becomes white, thus frying my pupils at full brightness... Maybe this is a glitch in the app or maybe it's not running properly on my phone. Either way, it's annoying AF. Other than that, the app is simple and easy to use."
46,Ur last update isnt working as the previous versions. I cant use it ofline. It fails to load the courses. And most of the time the text for the instructs speech is not available.
47,It's a very good app but at times it takes long to respond and it keeps stopping. It's kinda frustrating
48,"Please add dark or black theme, I really miss it"
49,App courses are nice but support is very poor. I have tried almost 30 times verifying my ID but it us unable to read the details. I have completed my course but unable to get the certificate. I tried from laptop and from mobile. From laptop it is unable to read details and from mobile it says give permission to access camera although there is no camera permission for the app. I already allowed permissions for chrome and browser but still it says allow camera permission. It is so frustrating.
50,I am not able to fill the financial aid form for other universities kindly look into the matter
51,This is the best app I ever downloaded
52,Good but cannot enabl you download the course to you phone memory
53,Great Platform for Learning
54,Nice tutorial videos
55,Its a very shameful üò°üò°from coursera They take payment but not activated my service when i contact to customer care they first response on my 2 mails said we forward your query to senior after that there is no response from their side ... 16 days gone no response from coursera worst experience ....üò°üò°ü§¨
56,"Top notch information, uses real course outlines, and easy to follow along."
57,Has lots of free courses. No ones asks money or your credit card number when you are studying for good
58,"Although app is good, but in coding assignment code are not visible and editor is also not compatible with smartphone."
59,Please add dark mode support üôè
60,Can't verify my ID. Have been trying for a long gime .but it's giving me the same error
61,"The creative writing course learning process is so poor. There's no experienced personnel to help in practical teaching. We are to teach ourselves like, how do you expect a learner to teach a learner? How?"
62,"Content is great, but the app..."
63,"Any non governmental organization (company) should stay out of political affairs, maintaining neutrality."
64,Actually I just completed my course. It shows free but after I finished my course we want to pay for certificate. I don't get this? Why this app is cheating?
65,Excellent
66,Amazing
67,Thanks from Russia
68,Is there any way to make transaction through debit card? .
69,Nice platform
70,"I just love this app, it has been a great tool for me to aquire potential skills to job ready"
71,"I have not had any problems with this, ""app."" Was able to restart my, ""Course "" without any problems ."""
72,Application is good but in somewhere in coding assessment it is not working as like in desktop it is not showing properly to write the code. I'm really disappointed with this point. Make it as early as possible
73,Top level
74,They app is vare iasy to use ‚ò∫‚ò∫
75,I love it. This is the second course I am taking with Coursera and literally is very good app and website too. I recomedent for everyone who want to change the career and doesn't have a chance to go to uni or college. Or even for people who has a degree already.
76,Coursera decided to play politics
77,Thank You Coursera. It is a great experience for me to be a learner at coursera platform. I truly say that this platform help me a lot in my study.
78,You are not a political institution. Shame on you.
79,terribly slow. Incompetent staff
80,Good
81,Late grade is given after submission of assignment
82,Coursera decided to jump on the cancel culture band wagon regarding political events. Shameful action to garner social media likes. I will not support this app any longer. Who knows what they'll randomly remove next due to social fickleness.
83,By banning the Russian courses and discriminating against the students who live there you are punishing many for the actions of a few. You give the anti-western propaganda machine in Russia the arguments to justify their position and literally act Russophobic yourself. Your decision is a shame for anyone who truly cares about education.
84,Sometimes the platform is buggy but overall experience if great.
85,"I used it for many years. Until they decided that people of my nationality don't deserve education at the moment when we need this education like an air, this is the only hope left. Their mission of bringing knowledge to everyone was nothing but marketing, they are liars."
86,"There are thousands of academics and ordinary people across Russia who are firmly against this war and now you are punishing not only them for the crimes of their government, a government that many of them did not choose, but also the rest of the world. The course that you have decided to suspend from HSE is non-political in nature and the actions you have taken are bigoted and will deprive the world of valuable content. I am deeply disappointed."
87,Why on earth you punish russian students for war in Ukraine by blocking Coursera in Russia? You idiots even understand that 99% of students do not support what is happening right now?
88,I need a job please help me out
89,For restricting content for russians
90,This app is a fraud.
91,Fantastic way to earn credit or a degree at a fraction of the cost in the actual University. They offer links to the best colleges in the country!! All available online!
92,"The app is suddenly full of bugs since the last update. Sometimes when I complete the assigments or do a reading, the app doesnt reflect that immediately like it used to. Right now, I cant even open the course because it tells me to visit the web as a new version of the course is available and it is the case with every course I am enrolled in."
93,Awesome üëå
94,üëç
95,"Videos are cropped in landscape mode, never had an issue with that until this app. Ditching it and using a browser instead. Funny how people get an app for everything when just a web browser does it better and you can control your privacy much better."
96,The best one app going to change my life step by step thnks
97,"Really good app, big number of quality courses, works really good. The only issue is that when doing quizes, the playground of code is totally black, cant see the code at all, I can only input. So it's kinda hard to know what the code looks like that we are suppose to fix if we cant see it."
98,"Bad experience. Needed a certificate for a college assignment. Submitted the peer graded assignment and even after being graded by a peer, I'm unable to get my grades. My assignment is now overdue. This problem had not been fixed yet."
99,Great app
100,Best way to learn
101,Before I updated the app I have downloaded some videos but after that videos are not playing
102,It helped me a lot. It's a best in building skills.
103,Bad experience. No technical support
104,Their Id vefication doest work properly and printed wrong name on my certificate and It is so hard to contact them for help.
105,"Great app love to study here, but now I am unable to sign in, neither on app nor on website. It says check your internet connection, my internet connection sy fine all other app and websites are working fine but coursera is not working. Kindly fix this problem. Thank you in advance..."
106,Excellent experience
107,One of the best apps ever with great courses used worldwide
108,Nice app but there are issues with ID Verification which deny users access to their certificates on completion of a course. The feature isn't flexible
109,It is a really good opportunity to learn topics we have always wanted and also things we actually need. The platform is easy to use and there is never a problem playing videos or listening audios. It is really easy to log in and it is not necessary to do it again and again which make it easier for practicing or studying when we have some time.
110,Oops Some thing went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try again.
111,Pathetic! Not able to verify my ID. Camera cannot be used perhaps given all the necessary permissions.
112,I don't know why but from new update the videos are not opening...
113,Really really helpful app
114,It is quite annoying that certain part of the course cannot be done from the app. It forces to use a laptop which makes me wonder what's the benefit of the app.
115,Worst app .It gives plagiarism for every peer assignment and even if you send your original work . I had sent my original work and they are giving me plagiarism and i changed my work twice but there is no change . I also sent mail to coursera about this but they didn't did anything. The information is also not clear in this app. Maximum courses are from foreign countries and they do not match our syllabus and what we want .
116,Cheap costly education. Pay your price.
117,"Capturing photo to verifiy ID is not working properly. Capturing is always blurred and has no option to focus. When app is used, the camera is not working and the permission to camera is not available."
118,Easy to use
119,It's amazing
120,Ironically sad how the app that teaches technology to people makes such poor use of it. Can't believe that in 2022 this app still doesn't have a good playback screen. Doesn't pause when the play/pause button on headset is clicked. Does pause when screen is locked either; just keeps stuttering and playing in the background. Doesn't have a dark mode either.
121,it's great platform for learning I have done many courses from here love you coursera and thank you so much for giving us this opportunity
122,Give a option to save courses for future reference in app and website. For eg. E commercial sites has wishlist option to save product for future reference
123,Good for learning.
124,"1* for now, for marking two quiz correct answers as red ""X Incorrect"" and giving the below explanation as to why it is incorrect as if the answer was marked Correct, and thus being treated as incorrect for the final score. eg. ""Practice is important for any area in which you want to acquire expertise"" got marked ""X Incorrect"" and below with white(explaining why) was the text ""True."" :))"
125,need dark mode
126,Excellent
127,I can cast my screen to my Android TV. Highly recommended. Is like a free source of knowledge. Also paid courses available. Subtitles in many languages depending on the course.
128,Good
129,Unable to download content.
130,Absolute trash platform with 0 customer support. Big data course is so outdated half the tutorials don't work.
131,Nice
132,Can't login with my email. My information is correct but it just stays in the login page.
133,"Generally good app but it ""forgets"" the user all the time. I have to log in again every few days. Very unnecessary."
134,"Not able to verify id, even after taking clear photos. What a terrible site"
135,Please add A Dark mode like IOS. Apart from that great app.
136,"For some reason, I automatically get logged out and then I need to login again! Uninstalled."
137,Grading system is quite frustrating. No response for given feedbacks in app. You keep learning hours and hours and end up with awful grading system.
138,"Awesome app and platform, a complete fan."
139,WaItInG FoR CoNnEcTiOn...
140,"Nothing more than website. There's no point in installing an app when it does its job worse than the website. It doesn't remember the video speed and, most importantly, doesn't allow me to take tests as the screen is ""too small"". I can do tests on the same device via website."
141,Best Educational app
142,"Works great as expected, just one thing tho. There are major bugs when I'm using it in dark mode. Im using Mi 11 Lite and it has a built in forced dark mode for all apps, but with the systems dark mode enabled the app faces issues like, page scrolling stuck, video stucks on moving backwards or forward and some minor freezing here and there. Might wanna look into it."
143,Nice app filled with much knowledge for those that can use it.
144,"Auditing a bunch of classes that interest me, gaining new skills, interests....i have about 100 specific courses that are on my to do list. Manditory for everyone is the media literacy course about being able to figure out what is mis/disinformation, taking the time to actually click on sources, verify information for yourself instead of taking someones word for it when their motive is to convince you of their way of thinking. Good stuff."
145,I like Coursera ...but despite strong wifi i am not able to download any videos...the server just goes on and on.. despite reinstalling the problem remains.. please fix it ...
146,Good course
147,"Lag, crash, doesn't keep setting set for videos"
148,Super
149,Nicer app.
150,"The app is amazing but I have two major issues that need to be solved. First, the font is too small for reading pages and there is no way to make it bigger than changing phone font. I need an option for changing page font during reading. The second issue, is some pages stick to portrait and dosn't flip to be landscape on the tablet. Thank you"
151,This is very good app for learning
152,"Unbelievable , amazing"
153,Interesting app to be proud of
154,ExcellentüíØüëçüëè work
155,Very good platform to learn. Please introduce dark theme. It would be amazing if we could take the graded quiz on the app.
156,Ya complete my course
157,Excellent
158,There is a bug since a minth and no one fixes it. AWFULL!!!!
159,Worst app
160,I am rating an app for the first time. And trust me you cannot afford to miss out on Coursera.‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏èüëå
161,This is very good app for the learners
162,üíï
163,No PiP mode!
164,"Worst Dont waste a single penny in this app, Coursera is worst of the teaching platform in the whole internet. Even udemy worst courses are far better that courseras best course. They dont teach U anything they give exersises and say u to figure out at ur own. I wished i had given my money to charity or somewhere else before spending it on this course. Just waste of my Time and Money"
165,It is very slowly app
166,I can't download videos .. what's the problem üòì
167,Good
168,the fact that you can learn for free is awesome.love it
169,I want to give 0 star. But it can't be possible. Because of the many fake notifications of this app. It will confuse you brother / sister. It will say that you can get free certificate but after completing you can't get any. It was already happened with me. So ignore this type of fake app.
170,Very educative
171,Greatest
172,Amazing App.
173,"Great site. Poor app. Skip it and just use your browser instead. Videos in the app regularly cut out regardless of connection. Text, especially math or programming languages, is often unreadable due to lack of rendering support. Special features like ID verification just don't work at all."
174,Great app
175,Great üëç
176,I am unbale to verify my account using just the camera from coursera website or app.Please make additional changes to upload document and photo. I tries a lot. Worst experience.
177,"I'm out $200 because these snakes changed the price on a class that I signed up to audit. I never sign up for trial classes, only ones that I can audit for free since I don't need certification, I just want knowledge. Well they changed it to a subscription of $50 a month with zero heads up. I just happened to log on and see it this morning, and even though it was within 12 hours of paying I can't get a refund. They also sold my phone number when I first made my account. It's disgusting."
178,Free to use because my college give an id to use and get the extraordinary skills from courseraüòòüòáü•≥ü•≥
179,Mantap abis
180,"Not sure what happened during the latest update to the app but its very buggy. I can't unenroll from classes, enroll into classses, or access certificates that have been completed anymore. Sometimes I have trouble seeing the content."
181,Here comes the karma for your false advertisement.
182,Fantastic app But hope you guys make it optimized for Android tablets
183,"Pointless. I couldn't remember my password from my account and trying to reset it within the app just gives you a constant loop without the ability to change it. Garbage design for a company that claims to be about learning or whatever. The service itself is good, but this app is an absolute mess. Just stick to their website."
184,Practical application
185,I cannot login after 4 lectures...full waste of time and money
186,"Cousera is amazing, however, this app needs to have some bugs fixed. Certain videos have questions in the middle of the video, but once the video pauses it's a struggle to get it to play again. Once you pause the video, playing the video again is a big hassle. Even though u press the play button it'll automatically pause by itself. Not a very smooth experience unfortunately."
187,From last one I have connections problem. How to overcome the problem. Coursera is not opening on laptop and mobile. Website and app also not working. What should I do?
188,Very good app and Coursera is simply awesome
189,Good experience
190,Fantastic
191,Best learning application üëçüëçüíê
192,"Horrible pricing structure, not very clear on what charges are going through , says a course is under Coursera plus but then charges for Coursera plus and the course. Needs to be clarified what money is being charged for what product."
193,"hii, im not able to install this app in laptop.... pls suggest me how to install."
194,Best educational app
195,I faced problems with my courses I started as soon as my financial aid had approved and when I finished the course I didn't receive any certificate also I can't do any change in my profile through this app
196,Just like it.
197,Is'nt downloading
198,"I applied in HTML course and video are not downloading, it is stuck on one point after that downloading is not completed in whole day."
199,"A super platform to learn whatever you wish. 4 stars for the coursera platform and the coursera support team. One star deducted for the fact that the app doesn't have any tool for note making/bookmarking/highlighting. Please add this feature as well. Except this, everything's perfect."
200,It's my real life education model.
201,Hi . I'm using a google pixel4a phone . I can't access the camera on the app. If I go to app permissions . There is no camera permissions option .
202,"When i try logging in with my google account, it makes me input the password and then it simply returns to the login page. i've uninstalled and reinstalled, i've cleared all cached data, i've even checked my settings on the browser, but alas the application is not letting me log in. the browser is perfectly fine though but you see, not everyone can afford a PC or a laptop."
203,Scamming. They promised me 7days free for try and then I need pay. My card was charged immediately ü§¨ Nobody want review my work. I paid for it. I hate the class but I can't cancel it because they will never return my money. I paid for certificate and I can't send any messages in week group chat. They promised group chat but I don't have it so nobody know that I need review my work. So I was just scammed for 50$ and I can't go to group chat and I wasn't able to have 7days free for try.
204,Terrible experience. DO NOT USE. TOTAL RIP OFF. Tried to cancel my subscription then when I demanded a refund they told me my subscription had been cancelled because I demanded a refund. I can't believe Google and other companies do business with these frauds.
205,It's the best
206,It is a good way of online learning through coursera app.it shortens the audience time by minimizing their time wastage.
207,It's very good üëç
208,It's good but my course download didn't resumed after i closed and later reopened the app. All other videos of that course were downloaded except one video which is stopped and not downloading showing waiting for connection. Poor interface.
209,I can't fully use this because their development won't offer access to coursework on small screens. I'm on a galaxy tab s7+ it's the only computer I have and for a tablet it has a big screen. But it's still not working. Make this accessible to people without computers or laptops. I don't understand why you can't
210,I AM NOT ABLE TO REVIEW ASSIGNMENTS OF OTHER STUDENTS. IT TELLS ME TO CHECK MY INTERNET CONNECTION. ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALREADY RE INSTALLED THE APP AND MY NETWORK IS PERFECT STILL NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK. PLEASE FIX THIS GLITCH IN YOUR APP ASAP.
211,"I downgraded my version of the app. Please don't install this update. It will freeze your phones. It's not stable. Coursera, this update isn't stable. Thank you."
212,"Such a great platform with highly qualified teachers and also if I dont even wanted to buy a course instead wanna do an overview of that, so it's possible."
213,Done many couses via coursera. User friendly interfaces and classes are up to the standards. Instant certificate available after the completion of course.
214,I've installed this app several times but either I can't figure out how to apply for financial aid or when I start a class it seems like the tests and the flow of the info comes too fast. But I've heard really good things for many years and it's incredibly easy to unenroll if I must or enroll again.
215,I enjoin using this application
216,sync course bettwen laptop and app. can even download lesson of offline usage. Good certification is another big plus.
217,App seems a bit heavey for cpu and internet. I will also suggest more free courses and reminders for students to maintain their presence in course.
218,This review was not designed for use on a small screen. Please use a computer or laptop to complete this review. I download MOBILE APP for a reason.
219,The application needs serious improvements to video player. It does not save the time at which playback stops and on return it starts from the beggining again. Screen rotation does not work also. Please take care to fix those bugs.
220,Good
221,I like this app because it gives me chance to learn more
222,I've got financial aids that help me boost my skills! I got a $39 course 100% free! The app is also excellent because it does not contain any ads.
223,"I completed my course, submitted every assignment and project but I was not given my certificate before my subscription expired. Even till date I am yet to receive it. The help desk have no solution for problems like mine. Its telling me to resubscribe again. üòñ"
224,"Great app, amazing courses, and splendid resources. My only complaint is that if I wanted to mark as favorite or save for later a class that I'm not going to take right now, I can't do so like other similar apps (Domestika/Udemy). But a magnificent app all together. Would totally recommend"
225,Amazing and beneficial app!
226,Courses doesn't verify the identity of the learner. This is a type of cheating. What does this certificate means for a learner?
227,"I am unable to download the questions in social psychology course . I have reported the issue several times, pls guide"
228,"if possible, please provide a version without google play service"
229,Awesome
230,This is so amazing and i bet you the world doesnt even known these opportunities exist I think someone needs to let them know
231,Easy to use and best for learning from great teachers..I feel happy to learn from Coursera app.üòÑ
232,This app helped me to build my carrier so bright.

248,Ok
249,What happened to FREE courses if you don't want or need certification? Looks like Coursera is all about the money now.
250,"This app is very useful but today I come up with a problem . In assignment reviewing section, I can't review others assignment.It says ""something went wrong check ur internet connection."" But I got no network issuse. Kindly fix this bug"

263,I like that I can cast it to my TV
264,"There is no un-enroll button. I have Coursera Plus and enrolled in multiple courses to check them, but now there is a BIG CLUTTER on my Dashboard with courses that I'll never be taking. Poor UI design. Will consider using other platforms for this very reason."
265,Good
266,Education is good but certificate system sucks.. I've completed 2 courses so far on and have applied for financial aid but I didn't get any reply back from them.. I like how the education is soo good on this app that my knowledge has significantly increased but what about certificate.. now even if I try to pay for the certificate there's no option after course completion..
267,"Worst app ever, they won't even let you submit your assignment even though there's time left in your plan subscription expiry. It's not a learning platform, it's a SCAM!"
268,not easy to update my payment
269,Good
270,Helpful
271,Loving it
272,"I completed my certificate in Foundation of project management by google on your website and I got a certificate with my name on it, but now when I am opening my certificate to download then at the place of my name on the certificate it shows SITE Name, even if I share the certificate with someone else then also it shows SITE Name instead of my name .... I tried to contact you but there is not a single email id i could found on your website to get help thats why I am writing my situation here..."

279,Best.
280,Nice
281,BUG 1: Audio being played in background even after Activity is cleared from Recents. I guess you forgot to stop the service (Audio Manager?) when activity is destroyed. Please FIX. BUG 2: Why do I need to sign in every time I open the app?
282,"Absolutely awful app , I subscribed for a course but after 4-5 days the subscription got automatically cancelled even after I made the payment and there is no customer support available it's a scam in the name of online classes."
283,"Hi. There's some technical issue that I've come across, while reviewing peer assignment it tells me to check my connection despite havin good internet connection. I have updated it uninstalled it, yet nothingseems to work. Seems like the others are also facing the same issue. Please check upon the issue."
284,"I am sorry for this rate,but really the application got stupid when I start downloading lectures, it takes much time and sometimes it fails to download the videos! Two years ago, I've started using the app and I thought it is just a temporary software bug and it will be fixed, but till now it's the same. Please fix this problem, as Coursera is my best platform ‚ù§Ô∏è"
285,Gud
286,"I can't find my country on your timezone setting. I'm a Nigerian, and I'm wondering if there are restrictions for Nigerian users? I even tried verifying my ID card but it still thesame problems. We have been using paper ID Card here in my country. Can your customer service help me through my identity verification cause I'm tired of waiting. I need to be assured of my certificate once I'm done learning."
287,I was worried about the refund hence I contact Coursera via mail and they reach out to me immediately and solved the issue.
288,I have been forcefully logged out of my account and I am not able to even reset the password as I am not receiving any password reset emails- how much soever I might try!
289,"Hey personally I really liked this coursera app but the problem is couldn't able to complete exam with in time because this app is not working in my android phone. When ever I tried to attend the weekly challenge exam its shows "" you can't complete this exam on this device "" . Unfortunately I don't have laptop. I know ,Without attending the exam I can't earn google certificate. So for me its waste of money . If this app suitable for android definitely its best app ."
290,It's alright. Where can I submit a complaint about peer reviewed assignments?
291,Learning made simple

325,"Please add language switch to the app. The Russian locale is painful to use, and the only workaround is to switch my whole system to English."
326,"It overwhelmed me right from the beginning. As a paralyzed Disabled Veteran who also sustained a bad head injury, until I know something very well, time leads to pressure. Plus, this thing is trying to charge me right from the beginning. I've not been in school since 1985 and it wants to throw a huge load at me? I'll find a free one that will go at my own pace."
327,It is an excellent and convenient way of learning. You can access to hundreds of courses on your smart devices and Laptops. Great work and I highly recommend you people to please enroll yourself.

344,I submitted an assignment but it showed plagiarized.. then I resubmitted an another assignment.. I saw many grades in this assignment but the course already has overriden it.. and still showing plagiarized.
345,"It's a great platform for the real learners and those who are deserving. It's practical, object oriented and conceptual . It perfectly matches any check box fir everyone. Seriously recommend it. Good job developers and keep up the good work ."

347,"The questions in the assignment are vanished and now I'm unable to submit them. I'm trying for last 3 days and despite of having a good internet connection, I'm still unable to view the questions."

352,Wonderful App I learned new skills here
353,"This app honestly has the best courses in app development, and yet this app is so incompletely designed that it would make it difficult for you to learn it either. On a serious note, the download section of the app doesn't work, the financial aid application can't be filled and the ID verification doesn't work either. It would be great if you could look into these issues. Thanks"
354,Trying to restart a course. First run was amazing. Great lecture on Audio Engineering. I'll be coming back in immediately. Within the next few hours. Big Ups
355,Excellent
356,I purchased Google project management course after I cancelled course within one days under trial period my money is no refund in my bank account but refund receipt are already issued.

360,"So expensive , i can't afford monthly subscription"
361,"I cannot log into my account with the mobile app. It says ""sign up later"". Please fix this."
362,App crashes while trying to open settings. Very disappointing and annoying. Lags too much even my phone in Android 11
363,Very good !!!
364,Super
365,good app
366,For a $400 a year service the app should be way better than it is. Casting to a TV is so buggy they might as well not even have it as a feature.
367,"I had best experience in learning with coursera, it's full of valuable learning courses."
368,"I do like this resource a lot, but I frankly don't understand why is it so difficult to add all the functions available on the website to the application"
369,Hello there I can not verify my ID and I tried several times and every time it tells me the photos are not clear and I made sure they are clear with good lighting and you are not letting me upload a scanned photo of it plus the security page says it expires in 1 hour but ot expires waay earlier than that .. I have no idea what to do now after I finished my courses to verify my cerftificate and I am very frustrated
370,I am un able to download my course certificate
371,"This app is garbage. It is very slow, and does not show anything properly my completed courses."
372,Best application for online education. One of the best feature i.e Financial Aid service that help the needy students to enhance their skill to build up their career without taking any amount of money. Good Service by Coursera
373,Excellent app for learning online courses
374,isnt working properly
375,If you shown as free app for courses in your advertisement then why would we pay ???
376,I cannot login with my college account on this app . But when I tried it in browser or in my pc it works well . It asks for my college url instead of my work email ID and I can't get through it as it shows some error messages even if my url is correct .
377,"I got an email telling me my subscription would be cancelled. I immediately funded the account, woke up this morning to realise the subscription was still cancelled. The help center does absolutely nothing to help. The app doesn't even provide easy navigation for effecting payment myself or re-enrolling. I've been on this all day, and never have I been this frustrated with an app."
378,3rd class aap...and had no customer support. I will recommend to all don't purchase any course from this 3rd class app
379,I want to pay for subscription but every time I try I am not able to do it .it's so irritating I have so much in this app but this is not of much use
380,Well done
381,"I want to enroll a course. It's not showing any payment options in any course. So how can I pay for it? And to get certificate for free courses, I have to pay, but only option available is credit card. I can only pay through UPI. And on official site, it says that Coursera supports UPI payments, so. How can I do that? In India many people are having the same issue, so is this just for India???"
382,Best platform for study purposes.
383,This is one of the best apps I have ever seen. I really like the financial aid system. If you do not have much money to pay for the course then you can apply on financial aid system. They will allow you to do the courses freely. SO I highly recommend this app :)
384,I am not getting the payment option i want to enroll and unable to contact support also ü§¶. Where should one go
385,A super learning platform.
386,Very good app...best for online skill.gaining paltform....recommended
387,"Can't open the graded quiz at all. When I press start, all it shows is a blank dialog box. When I tried to download the quiz, it didn't download either. Kindly look into this problem and please fix it as soon as possible."
388,Lack capabilty to perform ID verification
389,Insane experience
390,It's rare that i have given ratings to any app ever but this app's phenomenal. I would happily give 6 stars if it was there. Absolutely amazing app with amazing load speed. This called the innovation. Iam proud of y'll folks.
391,Its an excellent app for learning. I am learning korean and this app helps me a lot.üòçüòçüòç
392,Great

396,"I am doing a course in coursera and it has some quizzes in between whenever i am trying to submit it , its asking me to upgrade and once i am clicking on upgrade ,it is showing error due to which my course is incomplete Kindly help"
397,Very nice app!
398,"I am using this app from last few days I enrolled in a course but whenever I upgrade to submit my assignment it shows error in data loading. It's not submitting, kindly look into this"
399,It would be great if you kindly add Dark Theme feature for Android user.
400,"I joined Coursera to learn python. I took the Python For Everybody course last year and wanted to do it again. I did the paid course so I can get graded on the assignments. But IT informed me they could not clear my course history from the previous time, so I asked for and received a refund. However the next month I was charged again. Because apparently when they refunded my subscription was not removed? When I emailed them about this problem I got a reply saying they would not refund my money. the Python For Everybody course is excellent. Coursera is not. There are plenty of other programs out there that have better billing practices. I'm using dataquest.io right now, it is a great course."
401,Add the player to speed beyond 2x
402,Experienced content writer.
403,Good
404,Nice app
405,Supar
406,"Works great and looks good, too. Would be 5 starts if some basic functions weren't missing like all the filter options for courses that are available via browser. An option to bookmark a course or putting it in some kind of selection list would be great"
407,"This Coursera learning application is good as per my personal experience. However, as per my own experience, may I suggest that it could have been better, if it was easier to get a certificate, instead of endless waiting as when someone will see your assignment and review the same. I have finished my course and have enjoyed the classes. I have also paid for the course. However, I am still waiting for the certificate. Hope I receive the same."
408,App is very nice for learning new skills With diffrent courses. From our college we got subscription of Coursera for three months that's really beneficial for us to join course free of cost. That's amazing
409,Buggy interface
410,It deserves 5 star. no dark mode!
411,"Cannot peer-review assignments despite wi-fi connection and more than enough internet service. It keeps saying ""try checking your internet connection and try again later"" when there's plenty of internet. Fix this already. Thank you."
412,"I cannot submit my assignment, because of "" error loading enrollment data"". What's this ?"
413,Don't know why this app is taking time in rebooting.
414,Great üíØ
415,My learning on Coursera is not comparable with other platforms Coursera has done well by providing an interactive virtual learning environment that is almost in the picture of real life environment
416,"App is good, But please add some complier so that we can the program and practice coding."
417,It's very good app to learn any thing you want about programmingüëåüëå
418,Download video is painful Can't download videos and its buggy
419,"ReWi app for The Science of Well Being not working. The Science Of Well Being has now disappeared from my Coursera app. I've received no acknowledgement about completing the course. I paid for a certificate. I want it. I'm in India in a small village. Laptop NOT available. If pre/post happiness assessments are so important, fix your tech problem. I took them both. I now know not to pay Coursera a dime. No support. No reply emails are useless."
420,"Everything is great so far and I have got my 2nd certificate course completed. My 2022 new year wish to make my learning more wonderful will be a new function ""My Favorites"" to add new courses to my list for next learning. Cheers!"
421,"at first it helps me , it's working so well and I'm like I didn't open the app for like a month then UGH I HATE U"
422,Sala luttera
423,I like it
424,"What a great idea, for under $50.00 a month. You can get a college grade education. It gets you certificates that employer's are looking for."
425,It is extremely good for those who are unable to afford high level courses.
426,"I gave 1 star but I don't even wanna give that. Worst experience using this app I can't purchase or subscribe the courses , it's been a week since am trying doing that , just able to use the free ones. Why so ?? I don't wanna waste time and lag behind. Please do something to solve this ASAP."
427,Poor app. Your app is unable to download videos over wifi. Pathetic and poor experience. Edx is far more better than this app. Tried all possible solutions but no help.
428,Technical support has fixed bugs.
429,‚ù§Ô∏è
430,Coursera gave me a future for my carrer... Thanks Coursera
431,Not able to access professional certificate courses of IIT through app
432,"When the app works, it works fine, but usually it does not load My courses. They just stay blank. Sometimes they load very very slowly and then I can access them. They need to load in 1 millisecond. Should be easy."
433,"I purchased a course and I wanted to download them not even a single week classes got dowliad. They are stuck at 20, 30 , 60% and can't delete to restart download. Worst app to learn"
434,Very costly.
435,"Hi, can you pls advise me how to enroll with paypall in coursera for android? I only have 1 option, its only credit card option. Thanks"
436,"Application need to improve more.Lots of spelling mistakes, Not every file is opening perfectly and some of them are not opening too.Many types of contents,assessments and mock tests are not supported by this application."
437,Can't attempt coding tests on the mobile app because the editor is not working as it should.
438,Nice one
439,i finished my work in financial Market but not get certificate from coursera.
440,Slow to use ... doesn't load data in the mobile app... moreover there is no point of contact ... unsatisfactory experience... diminishing the quality and accessibility to the good courses in the website therefore.
441,"Worst courses platform ever, I DO NOT recommend coursera to anyone, it's been 2 months trying to get my certificate and NO ONE OFFERS ANY HELP, I contacted them more than 15 different times and the problem is still there. It's a big regret that I decided to chose you for my professional development! Every time I send the msg they say they will escalate my problem and it's all just bullshiit."
442,why I'm not getting 7 day's free trail and it's showing 1 month subscription fee
443,"saving and resuming ongoing exam clears multiple choice answers of the first question. it is absolutely not clear why an answer is wrong. As ""explanation"" for the wrong answer a text is shown, but --while beeing annoyingly generic-- it reads exactly like this answer should be correct. Paying $400 for Coursera Plus subscription to do courses by Google that don't provide any knowledge whatsoever (halfway through) and include lots of advertising how great Google is."
444,It's take 10-15 min for opening this app. There is a bug in the opening of this app
445,"I wish this app allowed us to bookmark and compare courses/certificates we're interested in - it's really annoying to go back and forth and try to remember specific names. There are several I'm interested in taking, but I don't like having to search for them every time I want to reread the description."
446,Cool
447,Very nice
448,Outstanding
449,I needed a refund for something I did not subscribe to. They do not give refunds. Because of this my rent cheque bounced. I owe $100 to bank and my landlord because of them. This is the worst customer service EVER! DO NOT PURCHASE AS YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF!!!!!
450,It's an amazing app that you can learn from! I really like this app because you can learn alot of different languages‚ô° Thanks for making this app its amazing.
451,"No one to contact only FAQ's, Having trouble in unenroll a course as no option of unenroll on website only rate course pop-up coming out One can't unenroll through app It's very frustrating, can someone from Coursera contact me please."
452,baddddddddd
453,"La aplicaci√≥n en Android est√° abandonada, tiene un dise√±o descuidado y no tiene modo oscuro como si sucede en iOS"
454,"This is a very bad app, it asked for my account details and money was debited from the account without my permission"
455,"It is a very good app, you will never go wrong"
456,"1. If video's name is too long, it's hidden by ""..."" -> cannot see the whole name. 2. Not optimized for uncommon display (other than 16x9). Part of video cannot be seen"
457,Very nice
458,"I've updated the app four times since my last review, where I was complaining about offline downloads not possible anymore and till now, problem still persists. What is the point of the updates if bugs aren't fixed? Please fix this, I've had to take a break from learning since October."
459,I am doing IT support certificate and I received one certificate in this course but my name is wrong in certificate and name verification is done fully wrong.
460,unwanted notifications
461,It's a good application it give lot of education .
462,Good
463,Hi When i go to ID verification i allow all. Permission but still show give camera access
464,Nice
465,Top class app for learning
466,"The app has its uses, but there are many times you're prevented from seeing a grade or assignment because ""it's designed for a larger screen."" But if you uninstall the app (or the webpage will just open it again) and go through the web page it works - on the same screen. This is EXTREMELY annoying when I'm traveling and don't have a larger screen available. Make the app open things and let THE STUDENT decide if they need a larger screen."
467,Developers of the app should take some more courses on programming...
468,Great
469,"I'm having difficulty reviewing peer reviewed works, It keeps telling me network error, I need help urgently."
470,"Friendly UI, easy to use."
471,Simply amazing .
472,Unable to get Persona to take a clear picture of my ID. No way to easily contact support and all online help articles don't provide an answer.
473,"I just updated the app and I'm getting this prompt ""We had trouble loading your data. Retry"". My internet connection is stable and before the update, I had been on the app without any problems."
474,I'll give this more stars if you can fix the fullscreen cropping. The videos were cropped on the sides. I don't see the full width of the video while in full screen on landscape orientation. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab A.
475,Nice app for free education and i missed online classes of lockdown so i am enjoying them
476,"This is a great app to study. But I cannot download videos. It's good when I use live. But when I download the videos, it shows just downloading videos and nothing happens. Please help me."
477,It's a very good learning app with valid certificates and also tests after a series of lesson...üòò
478,Bugging
479,This is 5 star worthy app. 1 star is just to get the attention. Add dark mode to the app. Your app way too much bright for night time viewing
480,Awesome
481,I was doing a specialisation while one got completed I couldn't move to the next saying that the data isn't loading:(
482,"Cousera is over all a very good and helpful app *plus its free lol* so that makes it 10x better in my opinion,i am homeschooled and i just love to use this app throughout my free time or if i dont feel like doing my normal work."
483,Not a single course available for vfx
484,Ok
485,"Smooth interface, genuine content, incisive teacher, and useful certificates everything about this app is impeccable."
486,After the update can't download the course for offline.
487,I completed foundations of users experience ux design course with account name VARUNA N With out if verification we can't get cirtificate ...during varification of my I'd ... I provide aadhar card .. it recognises name as GOVERNMENT OF INDIA instead of My name VARUNA N and suddenly update with out asking before issuing cirtificate .cirtificate issues by GOVERNMENT OF INDIA .... It can't change What should I do ... I don't think what bad user experience and option are not provide.
488,Gd
489,I am not able to review the work of my classmates on my course. It's telling that I don't have a good connection. Please resolve this issue quickly.
490,My course won't open All they show is just loading sign Even after I reset deadline the case is same....??????
491,"Not optimized yet for tablets and sometimes buggy as hell. I found this hard when reading section and at home page only available in potrait, not landscape mode. Also, come on, I regard my tablets as Laptop subtitutes already as it comes with bigger screen and physical keyboard extension. So there's no reason the exams cannot be done in bigger screen tablets but still rather identify them mobile as phone does. I'm tired borrowing someone their laptops only for exam purpose."
492,"As I am doing a grammar and punctuation course for free , so week 2,3,4 contains some quizzes which we had to submit for certificate but eveytime I try to submit, it shows an error in submitting and saves as a draft . That's why my course was yet incompleted . Kindly look at the prblm as soon as possible . Otherwise it is a good app."
493,Best app for learning language specially korean
494,Not complete
495,I learning Coursera about 3 month very satisfied. It change my life. Thanks a lot
496,This is the worst app. The refund for one of my course never happened. Another course payment didn't even confirm. Your help center is just FAQ's. What scam is this.
497,"The course content is greatly appreciated, but the subscription service was a bit sneaky in charging by the month. It turns out, if you take the monthly subscription upgrade, you do not have permanent access to the original course. Further charges are now needed per course. I would have appreciated distinctions between the two instead of making one ‚Äúan extra upgrade‚Äù on top of the existing purchase"
498,"I hope that it will be free,"
499,This app hekps me a lot
500,Excellent
501,User friendly and very intuitive. You guys need to improve on some of the courses mobile interface. Restricting some capabilities sole to desktop or laptop computers is kinda awkward and primitive sort of. You have the capacity to change the UX for better learning experience
502,Nice app
503,Best app for learning
504,Best service in india
505,"This app really helped me learn korean fast by their courses. The reason why I rated 4 starts instead of 5, it's because when I left the video that I just watched, and I want to watch it again, I need to start from the beginning. I hope when I watch a video, it will resume. (sorry for my grammar, i hope you understand)"
506,It has a huge library of tutorials ! Liked it very much.
507,Great support üòä
508,Good
509,I love the app but I am unable to verify my identity which has been making it impossible to get my certificate.
510,"This is great there is alot to learn, in easy way."
511,"Unable to initialize recaptcha, app does not work"
512,"It's not about the app but the entire platform. I purchased a course on 10th of Dec. Made payment via UPI. Amount deducted from my account but it is not showing up in my purchase history. Irony is, there isno way to contact someone in Coursera. All they have is FAQs."
513,I'm having some trouble adding payment methods.
514,Great program and courses
515,Just loved it
516,Nice app thank you!
517,Since I cannot delete my previous review. I take back what I said. Their customer support really helped me out this time. Just a warning to new users to always check your assignment as one of your peers (in whatever course you're enrolled in) will copy your work. It happened to me multiple times but Coursera is quick to get to the bottom of it and really assisted me with this issue.
518,Don't have much hopes for it but Let's see how this pans out. Alrready know how this is going to pan out.
519,I was not expecting such kind of bad speed from this app. It was not running proper in medium quality while YouTube is working with hd 720p without lagging. I watched a 10 minutes of coursera video in half 45 minutes. I was very disappointed from this service.
520,Nice work... Love this app
521,Video dose not fit right on xiaomi pad 5 ( 11 inches display)
522,"Great application, support team really impressed me, they get in touch and solve the issue real quick!"
523,üëçüëçüëç
524,Pour
525,No issues very helpful
526,Wow üò≥
527,"Excellent what can i say, absolutely amazing!"
528,"Perfect and to use,"
529,Awesome!
530,Don't waste your time this is a pay to ues app :(
531,Thanks for last year
532,What a nice app love itüíô
533,"After downloading the week 1 and 2 of the course am doing, I have been unable to download week three and the rest because no matter how I try to download it it won't download, it's really frustrating. also, during quiz, the app don't load code on the editor, I have to go through browser before I can see the code am working on during quiz. I am still having issues downloading videos for offline learning."
534,"I was doing the Google automation course which was great in the video department. But the actual questions are a pain to get through not because of difficulty but rather most of them are just ""fill in the blanks"" to get the right answer and leaves no room for creativity. Even if you get the same output as original code it still marks it as wrong. And for $40/month you get absolutely no costumer service I had to post this review just to have my grievances heard. Partial refund plz ü•∫"
535,"Sito di ladri, non iscrivetevi per non perdere i vostri soldi inutilmente. Non √® neanche possibile contattarli. Truffatori!"
536,Thanks for having financial aid option. Some of the courses are really helpful.
537,Great app.
538,Nice and good app to learn !!!
539,Good
540,Good place to learn.
541,Not that much used to it
542,"Troubles logging in, always crashes, ID verification not working. Annoying app."
543,This app is good but could've been better
544,I can't sign in with our organization info recently so can't see my process in the courses. Especially I'm using Windows login option with our company but application gives an authentication error.
545,Great app
546,I can't send my assignment to my friend then thay can review my work plz help me
547,Love using in my free time. I like the app setup and doesn't generally glitch on me. Nothing I've run into has been incredibly difficult but is very useful for introducing topics. Improvements it could use: - Display all achievements/completed courses (limited to 3) - Be able to view more recently viewed courses and terms (limited to 3) - Be able to favorite courses to take later - Have Agricultural/Biological Sciences categories/topics - Make specializations easier to search and navigate for
548,I thank you very much for developing this App to give us the opportunity to learn and improve ourselves and others. I really love üíï the App and I use it everyday. Great work.
549,I give 3 star because by mistake i set recommended section but now i don't know how to change it and there is no option showing so plzzz fox this problem i want to change recommended section
550,Log in error. I cannot log in to my account to same credentials which I use to log in in the website. Worst experience ever. Something not right!
551,"Hey there, I have completed my course of intermediate 1 but last assessment I can't submit there is showing upgrade bar. I cant understand that pls help me to get my certificate."
552,"Do something it's always say i don't have an internet but really i have a good connection, this just happened when i just log in on your website and its lag then i can access my account right now how do i going to finish my course. üò†"
553,"#Education is for all# This institution discriminate applicants according to their nationalities,if you belong to certain nationalities then your ID or passport are not valid in their system and you won't get your certification of completion the course. They will still charge you for the course when you get the payment page."
554,Great !
555,"""We had trouble loading your data"" - and that's it. Everything is fine in web version. But the app is screwed."
556,Useful app
557,You are at the mercy of others to get assignments verified and get a certificate. And poor help from customer support team.
558,I love the quality of courses and well structured lessons. Highly recommended.
559,"This app crashes all the time. I always get ""could not load data"" and ""no connection"" errors when everything else is working. When it works it is a decent app."
560,content is good but the apps is buggy as hell. 1. slow to load content 2. coursera app needs to force closed manually to make it load 3. some survey needs to be opened by desktop browser even it skippable
561,Not able to access the jupyter notebook. Please fix it. It's costing me time and money
562,Good platform
563,Excellent
564,"Amazing application for learning, there are lots of courses to learn new programing languages and best practices, and also there are free courses as well. So that's a good part who will learn new programming languages and update there stacks."
565,Great app for learning
566,"Actually this is a good app to learn. But i found a trouble with the review other's assignment, i cant do that. It said billions of times that my connection and network are in problem but actually they're great. Please solve this problem quickly."
567,good
568,"Coursera App helped me alot to complete my first course on Project Management Foundation and be awarded a certificate. Thanks Coursera and Google. However, I kindly ask that you allow me to do my tests on the other courses on project management on my smartphone, as it is rejected."
569,The Cast function needs serious work. It crashes every time a video finishes or every 2 videos if you get really lucky.
570,"Courses might be from colleges, but they're not college level. I finished the 7-week chemistry course in 7 days. Even honors assignments use no math beyond 6th grade. Sometimes after I select my answers on the quiz/HW, the app erases them so I fail the test due to 'unanswered' questions. HW feedback is limited to correct or incorrect - can't learn if you don't know which answer is correct or why your answer was wrong. Needed other sources to augment this class, which is just videos to watch."
571,The user interface is not good.
572,Very buggy and hellish app
573,Hiq111
574,Way cool.
575,Great app!!
576,I've been unable to download videos for a while now. It's not going through. Please look into it. Graci√°s
577,amazing program
578,It's good for learning
579,Nice experience.
580,Can't play videos
581,Just started with app and so far it's been great. Really the offline classes and all thank you @Coursera
582,Support option is very poor My name is shown wrong on certificate But there is no option for change
583,Good
584,Is there any option to take notes on app?
585,"I absolutely love Coursera! I've been able to learn so much, and I will continue to learn with the app! Thanks for a fantastic app!"
586,"I need to use the 'Verify ID' feature on the app so I can earn my course certificate but I cannot use it because it requires a camera permission which isn't even listed for this app. I looked everywhere trying to find a way to enable the camera permission but no luck. The list of permissions for Coursera includes only Calendar, Contacts, and Storage. Very frustrating!"
587,"HELP In case I purchased for 1 month for the course can I actually finish it in 1 month if there are more than 4 weeks of studying? Can I finish the course before those weeks deadlines or later? I haven't found any information about it in Q&A, thank you for your help"
588,App is not working so well. it's taking to long to load or open anything than usual. Please fix it.
589,Learning at my own pace and flexible teaching methods are the biggest catch.
590,amazing availbility of courses
591,great
592,Excilent
593,Outstanding aap
594,Quality knowledge at an affordable price
595,"My assignment are not submitting,but y .it shows data to be enriched.what can I do now"
596,ÿ™ÿ≠ÿ±€åŸÖŸá.
597,Ok
598,Best for me but i think they can improve rheir ui more better as it is somewhat typical they can make it easy to use
599,Not able to upgrade the course.
600,I would like to give minus 5 stars. This is a huge rip-off and a giant scam. They fraudulently charged me membership fees with no way to contact them or get help. Absolutely distressed trying to reach them for days. Don't even think of downloading this app.
601,"Does not work properly in phone, can't open assignments and certificates"
602,Excellent
603,"Worst app. These people can't even resolve my simple issue that too after more than 5-6 complains, mails, reports even through chat box. I lost my grades, I lost my marks in my college coursera assignments as well just because there was an error from the Coursera team."
604,Why is there no dark mode??
605,The support is great and there are many great variety courses here. Very impressive!
606,I use to this app everytime so it will be able to mention all of my duty as like ‚ô•Ô∏è my free time
607,Good
608,Very useful app for online study.
609,Good
610,Has a serious bug. Not able to access course even after payment. I am not able to complete any course of a specialization. I had applied for financial aid. It is approved but it is not working
611,GREAT
612,Please upload certificates in the app as well. And the courses are uploading certificates late. Please review the process
613,Nice application for good courses
614,Excellent dashboard.
615,Download option is not working at all
616,I wanted to enroll for a paid course. So do I have to pay anything additional for subscribing to premium coursera or it only includes course fees. Plz rervert asap
617,useful
618,One of the Best Things available on the internet
619,"This app needs a dark mode and some new accounting courses ( like acca ,CMA ,CPA )"
620,"I used to complete my courses in coursera website through chrome, I didn't knew there was an app of it, all of a sudden I checked out on play store about it, and there it is... Once I opened and logged in I can easily directed towards the course like a life saver."
621,Best
622,"I think the app has great potential. I had a good time completing the course work and felt like I learned a lot. Unfortunately, it wasn't smooth sailing. Specifically, there were a lot of little bugs that made it sometimes impossible to continue: I reached the end of course one and was given a link to the next course in the series in order to, ironically, make it easier to get to and start the next course. This link did not work and I couldn't even locate the next course."
623,this app isnt downloading in my device
624,I enjoy using Coursera for my courses
625,Coursera is very helpful for me because it have the option of financial aid for many courses because of which I can learn them for free. Keep up the good work.
626,Very informative
627,Love this app... learn soo much
628,I am very sad because the program deleted my account several times for no reason ÿå Please fix this problem as soon as possible
629,Unable to download material for offline use
630,I submitted my assignment but still say not submit ????? I can't even review my peer !!!!! Please fix this the deadline is about to end !!!!
631,There_is_no_customer_service.Never_use_Cousera!
632,It's great app ... But I can't verify my national ID or driver licence .. grab more and more ... I need to get my certificate ... Help center is FAQ only .. not help from human all help are bots ... Plz need help urgently
633,Only problem ....Too much slow and laggy
634,The Application is really hell we are here because of the content. I don't why they don't see these heavy bugs with this hell application.
635,‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡¶∞ ‡¶Ö‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶™
636,Thank you for letting us reset deadlines. Thank you.
637,It's good learning app. Kindly allow the feature to pause/play the video along with Bluetooth headset.
638,This app is really good for wanting to learn short courses and prove it with a certificate after completing and passing so i can add it on my resume. Im taking online vet tech classes through penn foster 2 year program but i want to work some where relevant to animals until i finish this 2 year degree and courseras free animal welfare and animal behavior class gives me that extra knowledge to apply to jobs with a little more experiance relevant to the job i want until im finished with school.
639,It is a wonderful application.
640,I didn't know this app exist. I ALWAYS OPEN ON MOBILE BROWSER HOW I WISH I KNEW IT YEAR AGO. NOT TO MENTION you can download and even cast it on tv for bigger screen LITERAL no need for pc. I been missing out alot. Not their fault they are not advertising the app on every popup.
641,Good app for learning online providing various courses
642,So the grading is just wrong when using the app there are obvious glitches. I would have suscribed to the premium service but it's clearly not worth it. Content is good but it's a pity that the app and grading are so bad.
643,Videos not downloading
644,I can't sumbit my peer graded assignment.
645,One of the best apps on my phone both performance wise and usability.
646,App crashing after update
647,Please optimize for the tab
648,"I didn't have experience i except from coursera app. It has many errors and bugs. Not loading videos, quizes in the right way, and even that your browser not support, but im using the app..."
649,This company just gives opportunity to people learn for free. Speechless
650,Great
651,Perfect ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
652,Very good app
653,Such a great way to learn
654,App is not working properly in my phone (Samsung M31). Its actually keep loading and not loads fully at the end. Tried reinstalling it but not worked.
655,After open the app when goes to course section after open the particular course sreen scattered and only some sentence are able to seen
656,Love it
657,I like this app is good
658,App seems unstable - very often crashes when trying to play a video or doesn't even open.
659,üìäüìà
660,Good
661,Fine nice good awesome fantastic excellence
662,üòï The app thinks that theres no internet
663,"At first it was alright, after updating now I am unable to download videos or materials to read offline. Can u please fix the issue"
664,"Whose job is it at Coursera to send defamatory emails. I was interested in signing up for a subscription for your services, however, I'm not intered in a degree in SKRUM. üî•"
665,It's difficult to download for offline experience. Why?
666,This learning app is a waste or trash. Interactions are not smooth and feels pretty old look and feel.
667,That's amazing
668,"App does what it should. Though there are few bugs. First, impossible to completely delete material. After deletion each course in preloaded material keeps having 10-500kb and just clutters visual(UI) space. It becomes harder to find what I need. Another issue is with list of my courses. It's not convenient to horizontal scroll courses in a specialization. If I take 5th course of 5-course specialization then I need to scroll horizontally every time"
669,"Awesome, courses."
670,Excellent application for learning onlime courses. I have completed 3 courses and currently enroled in 2 courses. The teaching faculty was excellent and they give at most support to learn. Also to engage with other learners student duscussion forums are available.
671,I couldn't download the videos! Why?
672,Code scrolls are not working in quizes.
673,The app is not displaying my real email. It cannot display my profile photo. It has given me continuous requiring me to verify my Id on only one specialisation yet the others do not have the same issue.
674,Is it an educational resource
675,Unable to login with Facebook. Logging in to Facebook from an embedded browser is disabled. Please update the app soon.
676,It's a good application for learners
677,"You got my Id name wrong. Now, i cant change my certificate name. Pls give a option to change that"
678,"After ID verification my name turn into Marathi ""‡§®‡•Ä‡§∞‡§ú ‡§Ö‡§∂‡•ã‡§ï‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ ‡§Ü‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡•á"" and Now, i want to change that and turn back into English i.e ""Niraj Ashokrao Aware"" and main problem is there is no support team to resolve my issue...How should i raise my issue ??"
679,No matter what I do I can't download videos. The download never starts. At first it worked with mobile data but now it doesn't work at all. Neither wifi nor mobile data works.
680,Cool
681,Please rectify issue with download. Videos will just stuck and keep loading like it is downloading but it will not download. Can not also stop tge download and retry
682,"The app was great until few months ago. I can't watch any video for more than 5 mins without the video starting to sound weird. I can neither download more than 1GB video material nor I can download again after deleting that 1GB video material that I previously downloaded. So I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to download new videos. This app was amazing, please do something to fix the issue."
683,You know how frustrating this is? Yes enable screen rotation damn it end my frustration I can't control my irritation and anger everytime I watch a video
684,Educative app I have ever seen.
685,Very informative
686,Excelent
687,This is really a great app to improve your skillsets.
688,Great courses!
689,"Coursera charged me twice AFTER, canceling there service. The first time I even deleted my C.C info still got charged. Emailed them it has been two weeks still nothing. No worries I""ll spread the word of what great company you are."
690,Good
691,Just recently I cannot play any videos through the app. So I have to use my laptop for watching the videos. Please fix it :(
692,Very good application
693,Kindly enable us to correct mispelled name after id verification.
694,"I've tried to submit my first peer review assignment, but it always fail. It said ""Sorry, we are down for maintenance."" but it almost 3 days since I can't submit my assignment. Please help me."
695,Good
696,I unable to play course video
697,Very much disappointed with this app.. I wanted to unenroll from a class but I couldn't.. Then ended up uninstalling the app
698,I love how easy it is to navigate. And you don't have to do much to get where you wanna go. Ads are always a problem in anybodies eyes. The experience has been great though. So no complains from me. Good work guys
699,"I've been using Coursera for years and recently it has become really weird. While EdX is transparent, Coursera is like it wouldn't tell how much you'll be needing to pay to earn a certificate. I recently enrolled on a course bundle/specialisation and paid for it thinking the courses included are all been ""paid"". But I could complete just 1 course from the bundle! Then why a collective enroll button? The charges say ""per month"". They NEVER said ""per course"". I feel cheated."
700,Unable to verify using app never showed a option to allow camera for verification
701,Nice
702,Crashes when try to close set goal card....
703,"I tried to register for Sports Analytics course from University of Michigan. It will show approx 10000 fees, very affordable fees..but when I click on enroll now ,it will show choose payment options with dead link. I add my card.. Then also dead link, can't make payment and enroll. Try to get email or chat support but nothing all I got is some stupid unwanted FAQ section. This app just spoiled my day"
704,I cant verfy my id for my course im from indonesia. I had to much take foto from browser but its nor really nice
705,"Coursera is a criminal organization. Took a course for which the lab tool broke half way through (going on 2 weeks now and not fixed yet). They refuse to refund my money or credit me time due to the delay. The course is 90% labs and they keep telling me to do what I can until the tool is fixed. Their customer service is the worst I've ever dealt with. The fact is Coursera cares about profit, you learning or not learning is of no concern to them as long as you pay."
706,Good but more Free content would be nice
707,I did a online course in Arizona University By using this platform Very useful üëç
708,I cancelled my subscription and they have continued to charge me for the last 4 months. There is no way to cancel or contact them with this information. All online forums have recommended I dispute this with my bank and it's been a really horrible situation. Save yourself the headache and just don't do it...
709,Great af!
710,Very perfect education app
711,My payment option not working
712,Una de las mejores plataformas de aprendizaje
713,Just amazing
714,‚ú® Sign up for the rest of your life
715,Good job! Keep up the great work!
716,Great App I love it!
717,I'm not able to review others assignments every time I try it show network problem even though the network is good
718,Useful for you
719,The best learning platform in the world ! Thank you Coursera ‚ù§Ô∏è!
720,Very nice üëå
721,Superb app
722,It's the best learning app ever. I earn lots of certificates through COURSERA.
723,"My last review was deleted,idk how but I won't stop. The app is really bad, logs off a lot automatically, the download video option is extremely glitchy, at times I can't participate or submit assignments"
724,"Is our transactions safe with you online,"
725,Good
726,"I tried the app once and the experience was good and bad at the same time. Good in the sense that I have the chance to watch offline videos in places with poor Internet connection. On the other hand, the app is quite terrible because all the lessons I've completed is still unmarked on the app. Hence, restricting me from receiving my certificate. Please fix this issue. Thanks"
727,"I don't think this app is properly optimized for tablets because the experience is not good. The discussion prompt box where your response is supposed to be typed in is very glitchy and difficult to use. Also the video player is too zoomed in when watching lectures, resulting in cutoffs of definitions and important figures in the video. Hopefully these errors can be resolved in future updates. (using Samsung Galaxy Tab S3)"
728,Great app! No complains here. Keep up the good work.
729,Keeps breaking. Not as detailed and smooth as the browser version. Wanted to learn on the go but well. Probably this app needs more learning than i do. Completed 3 modules and app told me to enrol like i have never taken the module. For a moment i thought my records are all gone! Unacceptable for an app to have all these bugs in this era.
730,Knowledge unlocked.
731,Poo
732,"Nice app. I've just deleted edx, it became dead. Hope you'll not go crazy and keep the app as good as it is now. Thank you!"

734,Excellent App and Experienced Creators... Your Destination for Learning New Skills Ends Here....
735,The app is great for mobile ipad and web. I just hope that you can take quizes using your mobile and ipad
736,I just don't like the I payed money for course I submitted all the assignments before time but due to not being able to review assignment for my last assignment I did not get the certificate plus not being able to reach the Coursera help centre.
737,"Not bad on laptop, but mobile app has a few glitches. The content feels watered down, plus you can only advance if you get other users on the app to grade you, which i think is both an auwful idea but also its used to avoid having real assessor's. There is a lot of potential but also i mostly just felt let down by the service. I tried the google project certificate. Once i completed courses it didnt show completed but just to reenroll."
738,Difficult to unenroll a course...
739,Highly recommend to late bloomers
740,√Ä great app for Education in all fields.
741,Great app!
742,My Course Dashboard is not loading anymore.
743,Very good application
744,Excellent app. It's a good think to keep graded tests on computers only.
745,Not playing video
746,This is the best for People who dint go to university and want to learn Some skill. Certificate or Not! Will give you real skills in the workplace.
747,The app is buggy. Very difficult to use. The progress is not updated on time. The videos suddenly stop in between. I really lost the motivation to complete the course. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it few times but still facing the same issue.
748,Opportunities offers this app is a great and I gave 2 star because of some prompt don't support android phone
749,I'm not interested in the course and cancel after few days and can't refund
750,I dont like
751,Would recommend to everyone! This app is amazing.It helped me to learn web development. <3
752,Courses are too expensive when compared to LinkedIn learning or Udemy.
753,Wrost app because it is not free ..price is too high we want free certification course once you will provide free certification course after that we will move to your app 24*7 Thankyou
754,Very good app.content is old but still it is great
755,"The app won't accept the email address used on the web account. This caused confusion, time looking for login credentials and the abandonment of my course for months. Typing in input fields in the app is pointless as the cursor keeps moving in front of the letter that's just been typed. The result is a jumbled mess of letters. Also the progress of videos isn't remembered, so if you navigate away then return you have to start again or guess where you left off. Feels like a broken experience."
756,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I really Lack Words. I have been in this app more than even all my social media Apps. I am able to access my lessons from anywhere with this app even without my laptop. I love you Coursera ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
757,Awesome
758,"A lil bit on the pricey side , but on the other hand such an amazing app with a really high quality courses thank you"
759,"Had expected more from the Android app. No dark mode, overall the load time is slow - both exploring courses AND while doing the courses, and navigating between courses. It feels very laggy and unpolished. Some courses are designed to have certain segments done on a laptop. And when you are on a laptop you wonder exactly what and why this exercise could not be done on mobile...! Other absent functions e.g. minimise video so user can multitask on a phone... more video speed selection on desktop"
760,"Not so much mobile friendly, developer, just add a zoom button for increasing the text size."
761,"There is a huge problem in verification of government ID. it's overall good for learning. But I am very upset by the verification process, it always show not verifies, check if the letters are clearly visible."
762,Excellent
763,Kindly fix the bug in immediately in the app is slow and also in id verification come full white background stoping
764,Exceptional
765,"All courses discussion are completely bugged... If you start writting the letters are positioned randomly and, at some point, it ends crashing the section with the message ""Sorry, we are down for maintenance.We will be back up shortly."" So I can't progress my courses on the app. Furthermore, the app lose the account several times (and force you to login again) and, when that happens, the offline feature doesn't work. It force you to login when cliking on any course item."
766,I have been on Coursea for about 5 weeks. Everything has been working great. I love it!!!
767,Nice app
768,Everything was good but when i try to download week 2 it stuck on 33mb and next day i try stop downloading but it's doesn't work
769,"The lecture UI could benefit from a redesign or atleast some new features, small but useful...."
770,I followed an course and couldn't get my ID verified.
771,Great! Please add the ability to mark/save favorite/might take soon courses.
772,Best
773,Very nice üëç
774,"In-app third-party tracking service are just toxic. I'd like get the option to pay for their removal. Otherwise, no more than 3 star rating."
775,The app isn't playing tutorial videos. I have updated the app and tried to play it again after relogin to my account. Please assit.
776,Simply best
777,Why theres no option for reset deadline? My course is IBM data analytics and using financial aid
778,Face id verification is worst
779,"My best study app. I don't need to go to college to be a professional! Please one more thing, quickly enable the feature so students can add courses they litw to a wishlist. Or maybe Star them while scanning through."
780,"Pretty much better in browser than the app, I'm using tablet and the landscape mode of the screen isn't stable at all"
781,"Excellent app, excellent support, excellent courses, excellent learning!!!!!!"
782,Best app for educational purposes
783,"I am learning very nicely,but my final assignment is not done always showing upgrade to complete I don't know what is the problem"
784,Good courses but because the government lied to me it turned out to be a waste of time. Educated or not im stuck farming for the rest.of my life. I just wanted my daughter at home so i took all kinds of courses but in ontario it only makes a difference depending on who you are and if the illegal title practitioners can line their pockets with the infant
785,"Awesome, the only con is I tried to read at night. So I prefer dark mode. Please consider it."
786,"fix submission links for android, i can't access my links."
787,It's good
788,if you are doing any free course and you want certificate..then you have to pay for it.. indirectly its not free at all
789,"The app is amazing, I get to learn different courses with certificate."
790,"This app does not load on my phone,keeps saying ""please connect and retry,, you can still access your downloaded material in the meantime"", even if am connected to the internet"
791,It refuses to load.
792,Nyc
793,üëçüèæüê¶
794,Great App. Though after the recent update I've not been able to download some of the courses. Downloads halfway then suddenly halts. What can I do?
795,All courses are very useful for everyone. Thank you for providing these courses. ‚ù§
796,"Download stuck even with a good network connection, and deletion of content problem"
797,"They're customer service is very effective and and responsive, it's a very genuine app"
798,"ID verification is a mess and broken after few attempts without any indication. Have already contacted to ""tech support"" yet NO adequate response to help solving the problem. This platform is a mess, has no respect to the hard work and time we invest in. SO DEMOTIVATING."
799,The app is great but they are many issues on the app such as Certificates not appearing on the achievements eventhough I have cometed multiple courses and only 1 certificate appears on the app. Hope this will get fix
800,All full of bugs. Dont pay any money for the certification guys. You need to submit the Govt ID to get the certificate. It will not take any if your ID and your money is gone. You cannot contact them as well. I'm suffering and lost my money time everything.
801,I can't even login!
802,great
803,"The app is very difficult too use. It does not recognise potrait vs landscape modes well. Sometimes the text boxes do not take the input, and the words get stuck on the box, but can't further type into it."
804,"Keeps logging me out everytime you update, very inconvenient. Udemy is much better, never requires me to login everytime I launch their app."
805,I left a review about the mobile apps courses not working on my mobile devices and it was deleted. The courses still don't work through the app for any of my devices.
806,Best to learn
807,"Love Coursera, hate the app. There's so many bugs in it that make it completely unusable at times or at the very least incredibly irritating."
808,Thank you for doing a wonderful job. Just wondering if you have a family subscription plan !
809,I just love it
810,don't respond well in dark mode
811,"I just love the app. It's very easy to use with excellent interface and user experience. What I will request Coursera to provide Search option in enrolled courses, because otherwise I have to scroll down to find the course out of many."
812,Good for videos and written content. Unable to answer quizes due to UI.
813,Best online learning app after 'SWAYAM'
814,Thanks Coursera!
815,The app is horribly slow to the point where I can't even use it. I'd rather bring a laptop and use coursea on windows....
816,Cant participate in the discussion forum.. Letters appear randomly and then it shows sorry down for maintenance.
817,I am not able to unlock course even I applied for financial aid.
818,"I've moved my rating up from 1 star to 2 star, some of the courses on this platform are great, but there are a lot to choose from so it can be hard to find the good one. The reason why I haven't rated it higher is because the app still looks and feels terrible. The worst part is the text fields used for completing assignments never work. This makes the app redundant for assignments, but at least you can watch videos on it, they got that right (sort of)"
819,Good and interactive but sometimes it takes time to respond or courses take time to load in specializations under My learning section
820,Please perform proper testing. Can't type. It's get stuck again and again. Wasting learners precious time.
821,Unable to Showing Certificate after Completing Course And Verify Id
822,This is a great ü§óapp for learner like me üòé
823,Good app. But fix inputs field for discussion in rooms
824,"I love coursera for its neat and elegant interface. One of the best feature of this App is ability for one-click download of the full course. However, it takes time in updating the data from the database and sometimes does not update. Secondly, it shows assignment Not submitted even though the assignment is submitted. Similarly its shows ""you are really getting close"" even if you have completed the course and certificates. Though these issues are petty, fixing these issues will make it perfect."
825,I'm unable to proceed with the course it's been loading and won't work .now I'm unable to download the app
826,Useless app. I am trying to enroll for Google Data Science Professional Certificate. Cannot at all do that. Updated payment information which led to charge of 1 dollar to my credit card and for no use. I still cannot enroll for the course. Sad they spend so much on advertisement but not on maintaining platform infra.
827,i am not able to download course.
828,Best online learning course. I really love learning on coursera so much.
829,Great
830,Coursera Certificate are very valuable
831,Best
832,"I cannot access the home page of the app. It's always taking me to the download option, even if I try as much as possible to ""refresh"" with no change at all!"

841,Nice platform to update and upgrade skills. Best of the lot.
842,Noice
843,Kindly update the app the earliest The features in the app are not feasible to learn.
844,The course provides through Coursera are worth learning.
845,"The courses are extremely limited. The video quality is awful (extremely glitchy), and the controls are as well (just had a video get stuck on mute). You also can't do the quizzes unless you pay, but they don't tell you until after you finish the quiz. And you also can't mark the course as complete unless you pay, so if you continue, you end up having to sort through and remember which ones you've completed. Or you can delete them and probably them all mixed up when looking for similar courses."
846,Excellent app until the recent update which doesnt allow you to login via facebook.
847,Happy wonderful amazing AppliCATion
848,This app didnt record my quiz.
849,"Like it , just want certificates for Syrian people and let the Politics away"
850,Good
851,"I want to uneroll from a course but I am unable, I have read through the help article on the sight, but not available on the course page. Pls help"
852,I have learn a lot. Thank you free courses it give us chance
853,It really make the world better place to live by providing easy access to education! Thank you Coursera
854,"This is an incredibly buggy app. It crashes frequently, doesn't allow the user to perform actions they should be able to do, and makes it impossible to complete some assignments."
855,"I'm not able to login through the app, it says ""invalid email"" or ""sign in error"". Strangely enough I am able to login through the desktop website which means the email and pass I've been entering for my account is correct. I don't understand the issue with the app in that case, why won't it recognise my credentials when the website does let me in using the same ID and pass? I even tried resetting/changing my password but to no avail. Please fix."
856,Parts of the video gets cut off when device is in landscape mode. Unable to login via Facebook as logging in via embedded browser has been disabled by Facebook.
857,Unable to subscribe!?!
858,I have used it before....there are many errors. Hope this time that I am installing it....they are resolvedü§û
859,"Coursera is a wonderful unique new world of diverse learning. The experience is better than most real class experience, plus the content is updated. As for the app, it has improved over the years."
860,Nice app for my studies
861,One of the best learning apps I ever used
862,So many bugs. I am unable to proceed with my courses.
863,The app is not easy to use. The information are not updated. In mobile the courses done by me is not appearing but in laptop it shows.
864,"Impossible to reach anyone in customer service, so I'm posting here. I did not use the app, but signed up online. I wanted to try the 7day trial, toyed around a bit and then didn't, signed up for 2 courses to get a taste then life blew up and I didnt think about it again because it was just a 7day free trial. Months later I realize I've been billed $240!!! And there's no way to get your money back once I looked into it, you had to refund within 2 weeks. I did not expect that they just auto"
865,"Many of the courses have tests that are vague and unhelpful. Also the forums are full of people asking why their test case failed, and most responses amount to "" the real world wont help"", well I thought I signed up to be educated, not to learn how to guess my way around test cases. Also a red flag should be how often Coursera responds to user reviews(see below)."
866,Good courses but terrible customer service
867,"Very educative, interactive and practical"
868,I really like itü•∞
869,Good
870,Amazing courses!
871,Great learning
872,"While it has some very useful features like downloading courses. It also has issues with how it frames the videos. These cut off important buttons sometimes along with other issues. However given the usefulness of Coursera in general, I'm willing to overlook these flaws for the convenience of being able to take a part of class anywhere."
873,App has been freezing and after few seconds videos or material also keep getting frozen. Download material don't add up in Downloaded section.

877,"I can't participate in discussion forums because what I write would be shown from right to left. That is to say, if I want to write ""maybe"" it would be on the screen as ""ebyam""! Fix Another issue is that on the website from Chrome I can press the button ""Start"" and I would continue from where I stopped. Every time I update the app, I must login out and then login in through Facebook again!"
878,Fraud
879,The courses are great but in the new update I can't log in. Facebook login for an embedded browser is disabled. Please fix.
880,The worst UI to ever exist. Isn't in sync with with the website. Absolute pain to navigate. It has great courses but the UI is very bad
881,"When I try to enroll for some course it always shows ""error loading enrollment data"""
882,Great app for learnersüíØü•á
883,Since I upgraded to android 11 this app won't work.
884,It's giving problems with loading data. I can't access any courses or enrolled courses. I need to use laptop. How can I fix this bug?
885,Very good
886,Images don't always load on mobile app.
887,Very bad I'm waiting for three days only for 1submission reveiw Its not give my submission reviewed
888,Not useful to me
889,Very pathetic very slow even in fast internet. Other apps work fine but Coursera keep loading to start when mobile locked and course loaded it start again loading. Coursera takes 10 mints to start which is really annoying. Slower than üê¢
890,"Tab experience is not good , it takes longer time to load all the courses."
891,Best experience
892,Really poor app... Lots of bugs...
893,It was a really great app before the last updating. But now it almost doesn't work. I can't review my peers' works and the app freezes all the time.
894,"When I load Coursera it's saying , connect and retry. I have stable net connection.how can I resolve this? I tried refreshing it but nothing's happening."
895,"Worst platform ever!!! You will wait for weeks to receive a grade. Also, they charge you a day before the renewal date they mention in your account settings. I don't recommend to use Coursera Never! Don't waste your money please!!!!!!"
896,y educational partner. Thank you for this awesome experience on mobile
897,This app teach how to make app but this app also need to update videos are lagging too much i am shick off from this app
898,Everything is perfect Except Assignment should be review by Coursera team Not by other fellow students. You should start a FREE DEGREE PROGRAM IN EVERY COURSE WITH FREE DEGREE CERTIFICATION
899,Great application for education and learning. Wish there were more free course options available. But great app never the less. üëç
900,"So many bugs with ID Verification page, it loads then suddenly goes blank, I have to close the app and open it again multiple times or be quick enough to click on verify my ID before it goes blank and even if I do, ID verification keeps on failing no matter how many times I try or different IDs, different lighting, different times of the day, different angles, nothing, and the same over the website as well, and technical support advice is to ""keep on trying please, you have unlimited attempts""."
901,Why say it is free when actually it's not.
902,"After completing the quiz and clicking on upgrade to submit it response with error loading enrollment data, why this happening?"
903,Good
904,I can't seem to write properly on the text boxes please fix this
905,Can you accept other forms of payment by fintech? I can payment by MoMo in some apps in Google Play but not for Coursera
906,Cannot log in. Bug fest
907,Decent
908,The video starts breaking if it is paused and then played again. Makes it impossible to watch videos properly.
909,Quite good app I like this app
910,I want to connect my id with Google account but it can't connect so I think that the problem will fix soon
911,"Half baked. My biggest problem with this platform is it doesn't track your progress very well. And it doesnt seem to sync with the website. Example: I'm doing a course that has 7 parts, the first part is complete I have the certificate.. it shows on the website but the mobile app wants me to enroll?! Other times I'm 90% finished with part of the course, but when I return the progress is gone. I like the courses but I hate the platform and UX."
912,MASHAALLAH khub valo......
913,It's been coursera from day one. App's easy to use and navigate.
914,Add upload option or camera switch option for verifying ID

923,Awesome experience!!
924,I can't open the description of each course before enrolment..
925,It is best
926,Often crash when resume watching. Doesn't remember last watched position. Ask me to entoll courses I already completed. Seriously expect a much better app from a platform teaching people to create apps.
927,It was dope until the review of your peers work started telling me that i do not have internet...and i was using the app and all other pages were working
928,This is way too unprofessional.. No features like: completed course. Unable to add payment details unless web version. No place to get certificate. Questions and answers don't much.
929,When i try the app it seems broken. I could not even copy the assignment to review hopefully please fix it.
930,I have enrolled to a course but still it is asking me to enroll in app please fix
931,Fantastic app for the content presented. üéì

935,"Reconnect issue....I am logged in to my account but the main screen says reconnect and won't let me see my courses or search for new ones, so I cant do anything."
936,This new update has a lot of bugs. Completed courses would not be reflected. Resetting of deadlines are now resetting of courses as it wipes away previous accomplishments. Some videos do not load also
937,Very costly subscription
938,"Good courses, but connection was errored more ... ""Error submittes"", "" Trouble collecting data"" , etc..."
939,Courses & Course contents are well designed by and with adequate details; Wide choices; delicered by experienced & experts in respective fields.
940,Hey!! Coursera uses a very low standard face recognition 3rd party app. And also the article about the problem which I'm facing of not verifiying is missing in help centre. If anyone in coursera read this please resolve my this issue. Thanks
941,Very very wonderful app I appreciate this app It helps uneducated
942,"The certificates are quite hard and time consuming to get only to see that they aren't any actual certificate, they contradict themselves saying that your identity is confirmed then that its not. It's a genuine certificate, yes, but it also says that its value is so low it's actually a joke. Don't waste your time and money in here. The certificates say that they are by no means a real certificate. It's like a game, only that's paid, boring and has no real use when trying to get a job."
943,"App is not really functional - it does not let you view most course content, or do any work, on a mobile device."
944,I would say this is a good thing for underdeveloped countries because we don't often get a good education at home this will help a lot .one thing about the professional certificate courses offered is that you should at least try to connect us with an online job opportunities after completion.most people will benefit from it!
945,"Coursera, I rated 4, it's my first to rate an app to 4 star. Coursera deserves more. Inshallah the upcoming years it will host many learners."

952,I cant enroll for a particular course its showing error in loading im trying from passed 2 weeks please let me know whats wrong
953,This new update is horrible unable to watch the videos as they are stopping in between the videos are not running smoothly
954,A boon to our generation!
955,Please provide proper payment gateway Can't make payment for Google UX design course. Very disappointing service of Coursera in this case. Such big platform makes such bad experience Coursera please get better engineers to resolve this solution.
956,. Download It! ... [;)]
957,Loops Forever
958,I wish the app has a separate theme of its own instead of just adapting to the phone's theme which reduced the readability.
959,It is so awesome .
960,Good for student in india
961,"Reading is essential activity for the user of this app. So... Where is font size selection? Where is landscape orientation? Where is preventing device from screen turning off? Please watch some of UX courses available on Coursera, probably you'll begin to empathize your users a bit better. Thanks!"

982,Thanking you
983,"First and the biggest problem is that if i am facing any problem related to course then there is no one to one communication for help,you can't find anyone to make your problem solved. Just like me i am not geting my certificates as there are issues with my id verification and no one is there to help me regarding this. Worst featured ."
984,"Nice app, career building"
985,Ugandans rarely rate but when i do #believeüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
986,I m not getting the refund page... it's really difficult to get refund... renewal is done without asking..
987,Looked fantastic
988,"Hi,  I have enrolled for IT support in Coursera, but I'm having technical  issues from your side completing it. I have to contact you because I couldn't find other ways to reach you for help. Your learners helpdesk doesn't work. Shows the error (something went wrong) I'm having technical issues completing the Linux practice test, even I know how to do it i can't type any space in the command because it deletes the whole command whenever I type any space. Kindly complete my course as I've learnt"
989,"The video player on the App fails to load the videos frequently, not all the subjects or contents are optimized for the App, so you need to use PC for the course. Sometimes some contents are not visible at all. So you will lost pace. They actually need to improve the app to works as good as the PC experience"
990,doesnt load lessons anymore
991,Love.
992,Great platform for learning!
993,good but app doesn't work well
994,"Terrible app,at least on mobile.couldn't use discuss feature, video always crash,too many to say but im not free to tell all."
995,Google analytics quizzes are not supporting on my mobile device.please fix it
996,Not able to enroll my course and not able to downlod my certificate
997,i do really appreciate guys
998,"Really terrible UI with constant errors, most of which are false. In some cases I do not have access to my PC so I need to use the app. Almost impossible to complete tasks and lessons most of the time, unless I am passively watching a video."
999,"In its browser version, Coursera has always been a free and high quality plataform. Thanks for that. Nonetheless its app is unstable, my courses content is unable to be shown and turns this app into a useless one."
1000,"Its either not able to load my data, or is denying me access to enrolled courses, or doesn't let me log in. Coursera has good content but is probably the worst app ever."
1001,Amazing app.
1002,"App is not able to play the answer choices, so I am not able to make a selection and proceed to the next question."
1003,"Can't enroll for a course. It showing error again and again, whenever i am trying to enroll for a course."
1004,This app freezes my phone and reboots it Everytime I download it. I'm taking online courses with it. And I'm always behind schedule coz of that. Update the damn app!
1005,Excellent
1006,New courses must be added regularly
1007,Currently the progress done on the mobile app is not in sync with the web application. I completed a week excercise on mobile but they are not showing completed on PC(web application).
1008,"I have use it on my android phone,but i have major issue when i write in activity portion for discussion at end of week of the course the alphabets mixed up with each other kindly resolve this issue in new update. thank you"
1009,I have issues paying for the course I was studying (Google IT support) and I was locked out. I made many attempts to contact someone from Coursera to no avail. I eventually abandoned the couse.
1010,"The only issue I have with the app is that pictures included in readings are not downloaded with it. Other than that, excellent place to learn!"
1011,"It said in first that this is 7 days free trial and you can cancel any time,, but now when I am trying to unenroll it,, it is showing nothing!! What the hell is happening"
1012,"I can't upload my ID, it's a requirement for my certificate. I have tried multiple platforms and devices, and browsers. Nada. There also is no actual phone number for coursera."
1013,I'm yet to use the app. Please how long does the certificate last?
1014,Best app I have
1015,"Video quality can't be controlled. When I try to change video quality the video player crashes and have to restart the video with the default quality option. Video is not playing smoothly always. Most of the time it drops frames, get stuck and lags."
1016,Cool app
1017,Bandwidth requirement affects my studying hence my 4 star review
1018,"Free knowledge, Paid Certificate..... That's why we love this appüî•"
1019,I love the app but every time I try to fill in a discussion prompt it write from right to left and I cannot change it.
1020,"Cannot download lessons. I get the error ""Downloading failed due to insufficient space"" although I have 4GB of free space on my SD card. I can't download to my phone storage as well. It's just 3MB of standard video."
1021,that is so helpful
1022,"I love how it's organized and it leads you straight to what you need , not complicated at all"
1023,"I did a course and after completion the system took my parent's name in for verification , and I am not getting any help since to change it to my name in the certificate."
1024,An excellent application for Android phone.
1025,No value certificate in job.
1026,"Nice application , I love it so much."
1027,I love the opportumity.
1028,"Variety of fields to choose from with different courses, sorted according to the level of difficulty. Great tutor and interactive forums. This is first time I am saying this it is fun learning with coursera. Thanks"
1029,Login error is showing up
1030,Huge Issue: On multiple choice answers the answers are exactly the opposite of what should be. I have seen this in google and IBM courses and I can't find a way to report them. Bugs: Unable to type in discussion text box. After every character the cursor moves back to the initial position and gets stuck. Missing: Reverse landscape for videos.
1031,It's an affordable and user-friendly app. Course presentation and study materials are very up-to-date. Here every course is like a palatable dish!
1032,This app is terribly slow. Learn tab keeps loading forever.
1033,"Pros: streamlining lecture videos and quizzes. Cons: can't save notes, can't leave feedback (both of which are available on the web), UI is wonky (even moreso after a quiz)."
1034,"I liked the previous UI. This new UI reloades all cards each time I back to ""Learn"" tab which is very annoying. The previous Round shapes with course number was better."
1035,Frustrating errors and problems
1036,Awesome app with doors to new world of knowledge. I love it.
1037,"Not able to log in after update. Our college mandates us to do a few courses in Coursera and getting to do it on the phone is so much easier, but after this new update. The app doesn't sign you in. I always sign in with Google and it used to sign me in before, now it asks for a password and even after entering the right password it loads for a while showing ""signing in"" and then again nothing."
1038,Is this free
1039,"Absolutely horrible app. Taking tons of time to load the courses. Plus for certain courses you cannot take quizzes on the app. It is still designed for laptop usage rather than mobile usage. Wake up coursera, most people are learning using their phones nowdays."
1040,Thanks for your free courses!!
1041,Really love it as expected
1042,When are you guys enabling a dark mode for the app? Do this and get a 5 star ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1043,As you offer several courses all over the world please make payment option better I am not Able to make payment for my course from debit card which is powered by visa and you accept the visa cards. as a big organization its your responsibility to make payment option better I am trying to pay for my course by PayPal but it's not accepting any of the payment methods I request you to please fix this as soon as possible Thank you..!
1044,Sir i am not able to download videos. Please solve this issue.
1045,An excellent app to study. I can't tell how is this app help me to study.
1046,Best platform
1047,One of the best learning platform
1048,problems with payments. frustrating.
1049,"The app is great (way better than edx's). It lacks a dark theme, though (please, give us a dark theme)."
1050,Nice
1051,Good app for all world please call me .I love you baby
1052,I can't even play the videos then how am I supposed to learn through this app. And I don't know were can I report this problem.
1053,Only one thing that is missing from this app is the landscape mode that would bring a huge leap in the usage of this app. One star less for absence of landscape mode.
1054,Excellent initiative
1055,Coursera is fine with me
1056,"Great except one problem, i went to get my certificate and all of my test scored were gone and it said i was unenrolled i completed a six week course not happy about this part at all! Other than that great course. Introduction to psychology, Yale university."
1057,This app has alot of great information.
1058,Coursera gave me access to unlimited education. No matter where you are you still can learn with coursera.
1059,good!
1060,Thank you google and thank you coursera
1061,So if you have trouble uploading your project.. there is no support to contact. Basically you will be late and not get to move on. Who doesn't have a support? So stupid.
1062,Cannot subscribe. Failed to join course. Please try again.
1063,Excellent thanks
1064,Creat company and Great App
1065,"Their is a problem in your app,that I want to change my password because I forgotten it. But the link given in email redirect directly into my account and from their to change my password ,I need to know the current password which I have forgotten.. And where is the feedback section in the app...üôÑ Although it's a good app with full of useful stuff üòâ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1066,Goof
1067,"it's kinda slow to load and the course reminder just won't appear (i already set the notification to high importance, but still didn't work)"
1068,I'm using Coursera on a tablet and it would be better if the app can be designed in such a way that it can stay in landscape mode. It's hard when the app keep shifting like when viewing the homepage it stays on portrait mode and when you click a course it could be in landscape or portrait but when you go back to home only portrait is available and you have to tilt your neck every time! üò™
1069,Lots and Lots of bugs. Video breaks every 5 seconds. Irritating üò°üò°
1070,Amazing!!! It helps me a lot!!!!üòÑüòÑüòÑ
1071,I cant log in with my account .. I dont know why .. and this happened only on app
1072,Amazing to have free or very low prices in courses
1073,Incredibly slow and like an obstacle to learning. Worse yet it doesn't recognize tablets so have fun in portrait mode using a website designed for landscape. Really stunned by the Jank. Sticking with the website for now
1074,This app Always collapses with android devices!
1075,"If you want to take classes from your phone or tablet think again, The quizzes do not play well with Android in a chrome browser or this app. keyboard does not work all the times and the question boxes format is messed up, you can't even see the question."
1076,This app has been very beneficial to my growth in data analytics. Thank you very much Coursera
1077,"Nice to have an app, but text entry is completely broken. Being able to download the videos/lessons is particularly nice."
1078,"Completed multiple courses, friendly usable site."
1079,Only portrait mode
1080,Video playback is resetting in every 10 seconds.. can't view the full video content properly
1081,Super
1082,Handy
1083,"""NEW IDEAS EXPLORING"""
1084,Not able to login. Showing an error to check the internet.
1085,I can't access my current courses it is saying trouble in loading your data
1086,It's awesome and very useful app
1087,One of the best learning platform I've seen. Kudos to the developer
1088,This app doesn't work after updating..
1089,"Experience was good but it has some bugs when I open reading documents, the lightning of the screen mode switches constantly, from dark to light and makes very difficult to read my assignments, if you could fix that lighting problem on the readings it would make a big improvement for read on the go. Thank you."
1090,I love it.. I would like to suggest every one to download such amazing app.. üòòüòò
1091,I have a bad bad experience with this app after a finished my first week on a course the application freezed and when I reopened it all my data disappeared. .. and keeps telling me that we had a trouble loading your data ... Well if you have trouble then fix it
1092,My courses disappeared halfway and now it's asking me to re-enroll
1093,"Hi! Dear developer. I have just updated the app now, and it crashes a lot. I can not access my courses at all on the app."
1094,Rubbish
1095,"I lost all my enrolled courses. It shows you have not enrolled any course yet. Also, it is showing we had troubling opening your data when I'm exploring new courses. Please fix this issue ASAP."
1096,"Good app but lots of bugs inside the app.I have enrolled for 2 courses and I was in week 4, suddenly it shows as I haven't enrolled in any course yet.The discussion forum doesn't even seems to work for the past 1 year.Hope this will be fixed soon."
1097,Wonderful course presentation and really now my go to for my self fulfilment courses. What a wonderful resource!
1098,"Best MOOC app for me. Coursera, thanks for existing."
1099,The audio buttons don't match with the material in text at all üòÇ Learning a new language and I have to do an unprompted matching type to find the audio for a specific line because all audio buttons are scrambled at the bottom of the page instead of in the text lines as seen in the desktop version. App is plain bad.
1100,"Unfortunately it doesn't sync with website, so my progress doesn't show in app"
1101,Machine Learning is recorded in pretty bad quality in terms of sound quality as well as accent of the speaker.
1102,It's a good app and good experience but when I download videos and later when I start to watch it offline it shows there is a error (network problem ) plss tell how to solve it and if there is a problem plss solve it!
1103,Pretty good !
1104,Awesome for learning new skill
1105,It has performance issues i am doing a course and i have completed from my sight i have completed the peer review assignment but in grades tab it shows assignment not submitted when i open the assignment to check it says assignment submitted it is happening only in mobile not on web or not on laptop and also I can't attempt discussion prompt in any course if I am on android I am typing what and its showing hawt seriously? kindly fix these issues also mobile app is slower than web version
1106,"There is no option to study German among the language courses. Besides that, its a really nice app."
1107,A great platform for learning. A recommendation: Certificates should contain signatures from a person instead of e signatures of organisations.
1108,Excellent
1109,Thank you for all the information you provided
1110,Very useful and wonderful teaching environment in online.
1111,Wonderful and useful app
1112,Why i dont have a save option for courses? I dont want to enroll for a dozen at the same time.
1113,Amazing platform
1114,Not perfect. Many data are not saved.
1115,Terrible UX.
1116,Getting no connection error even with good internet connection and also getting loading forums & loading course content errors.
1117,Awesome
1118,Very good
1119,"This app is no where near my expectations! Everything is slow, from buffering to downloading. Even readings are slow to load. I can't complete q songle course on this app."
1120,So many bad reviews...now i m in doubt whether to enroll for the certification or not
1121,Won't let me play videos anymore without downloading. Very buggy app.
1122,"Pasa rapido la plata, pilas, habla bie, esta nota appp estuvo mostrosa, a lo biem."
1123,Best platform for learning. Great courses with high valuable content.
1124,It is wonderful.I have learnt a lot.
1125,It is the most absurd app if you're asking for support. I can't verify my ID even after trying all the government ID I had. Though I have mailed customer support countless time it was utter failure. Now I'm stuck completing the course without any certificate without any support from them. Guys DON'T DO CERTIFICATE COURSE FROM THIS APP. Go on to edX or Udemy. They have a lot better courses and helpful support.
1126,I like it
1127,Google courses‚ù§‚ù§
1128,I learn a lot.
1129,"New and Update UI is fluent, Smooth also there is no almost no bug also server error during switching apps is fix ..."
1130,Most of the courses are outdated
1131,Literally not possible to write in the text box in discussion prompts. Doesn't work with embedded audio files of the course material to play through the app too.
1132,I did the bits and bytes of computer networking course on coursera site and when I get certification that certificate not contain my name on it please help me.
1133,Okok
1134,Improve login and landscape mode. Sometimes I need to login into app again and again. Except videos rest of content doesn't go in landscape mode making hard to use on tablets. Plz resolve the issues
1135,Thanks to all teachers of Coursera
1136,New update have a problem 1.It's good it shows the cousres which are in specialization but I am not inroll But it also shows which I have completed. 2.The new features for time period for inrollment is not good.
1137,Simplicity at its best
1138,"Functional, but does not work in landscape mode, which is bizarre. I've tried it on a few devices, but it remains on portrait mode. If you want to download the course materials then you need this app, unfortunately. The app also does not download all the course materials such as notebooks etc., so it's a bit of a pain if you want to archive anything offline for reference as you still need to get these manually even though you've clicked to download everything for a particular week."
1139,"Hello, My cousera app requires an app update everyday even though I recently updated. Please check the issue."
1140,Awesome platform for learning new skills
1141,Good
1142,Needs fixing! A lot of the quizzes shows as blank and totally inaccessible or cannot finish. Both Android and Ios have this issue!
1143,Great app. I download course sections and study wherever I am.
1144,Nice
1145,"The application isn't functioning, it keeps saying there isn't an internet connection. I tried many connections but it's still the same. Please fix it ASAP. My phone is Xiaomi Redmi Note7."
1146,Custodia support is reliable and fast!!
1147,Fantastic
1148,Good
1149,"VERY GOOD PLATFORM TO STUDY. IF THE CONCERNED PERSON OR AUTHORITY COULD ADD COURSE ON HYDROLOGY AND WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IT WOULD BE GRATEFUL"
1150,I have enrolled for ui/ux course but because of peer graded review I am not able to continue because there is no peer very few students continue further and there is no one who check your assignment so how can I will get my certificate even after submitting my assignment
1151,Great app
1152,"I'm having issues with my offline videos. It plays fine for a few minutes, then starts to break, and the app starts to freeze, and I have to restart it for normal operations to resume"
1153,It was great. Valuable information . good opportunity to learn.
1154,Had subscribed to a course which supposed to have 7 days trial. But it costs $53.34. Content quality was very poor. Even the course teacher said in one lecture that do not expect much from that course as it was free! That's mean they are selling those poor free content for $48.99 to $53.34 . Did not expect such * business model.
1155,Why is that anytime I try to type on the forum space it kind of malfunction... letters repeating itself and so on why?even on the site ..now I can't even finish my python assignments and submit them
1156,Well and reliable application
1157,"Coursera SCAMS you on IBM class, asking for more money inside course. You PAY subscription to coursera; PAY AGAIN to use IBM's cloud services to complete graded assignments. IBM's content says they will not charge you for using their cloud services as a student on their 'lite' cloud plans, but still requires your credit card again to complete assignments. Coursera refuses refund and no warnings about this. Contact DOJ and COMPLAIN if they scam you. Taking advantage of unemployed students!"
1158,Nice platform.
1159,Keeps saying site down for maintenance. Been this way for a few weeks
1160,"I just noticed I no longer have access to camera, tried fixing it on on phone settings still nothing. What can I do please as I really need it for ID verification."
1161,"I am unable to use the text input on the course work for Google UX accessible design, quite ironic. Instead, every time I type, it moves the cursor back to the start of the line. Other than that, I am enjoying the all immensely. 5 stars once I can complete my course work"
1162,Can't see lecture when Dark Mode (Dark Theme) is active. Text color is black and background is black too. Please fix it. Thanks
1163,"This is a good platform. However, I am looking for Solidworks Lesson, but they don't have one. So, I hope there would be soon."
1164,"For an educational app, it has a very poor user experience. No accessible contact support and the prices keep showing in $ and not in my local currency (Naira). Poor user experience!"
1165,"Everything is good about this app expect payment methods for india. Its horrible, I tried to pay from my debit card they reject this, I dont know why I also turned on internation transfer. Then I tried to pay from credit card but still I got error - sorry there was a problem proccessing your payment. I'm hopeless right now, its about 1 week I'm trying to pay for the course but there's no solution from there. I contact customer care too, still same issue."
1166,have enrolled for Google Data Analytics by paying Rs 5005.00 But now coursera shows that I have not enrolled for any course. Why have this happened? I am very disappointed.
1167,Needs ability to zoom into videos whilst playing
1168,Excellent
1169,The app is great! I just want to have the save note feature in there as well same as the website version
1170,"Love Coursera but this app does not work. I tried signing up for courses and ended up with endless ""could not retrieve your data"" messages. I uninstalled."
1171,"The app always shows that there is no connection (check your connection). However, the connection is superb, the speed Is up to 100 Mbps, and this is the only app where the problem appears. I had to uninstall it. Very disappointing!"
1172,International it
1173,"On every run this app looked like I was logging out, and dashboard refreshes for a couple of minutes after loggin in. It would be great to keep users logged in."
1174,It makes learning easier for me
1175,It's good but the course are much more expensive to African students in general.
1176,Awesome
1177,We have try open but it's showing offline then I have try to update but still not updating it's wash of time üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
1178,I didn't like that the 7 days trial is not 7 actuva app usage day so it expires even if you haven't launched the app in that 7 day....
1179,It's not able to be opened on Android phones
1180,Well done
1181,Great app! Just having issues typing on the discussion boards. Gave one star to get your attention. Whenever I try typing the cursor doesn't move. Reach out to me if you need recording
1182,Great
1183,The platform is nice for learning and also the UI is easy to use but this app is extremely slow which makes it boring and time consuming
1184,I see great opportunities with this app. It is also straight forward and easy to use.
1185,The video player is not working at all. I tried to uninstall and reinstall the app. Still the same.
1186,This app is helpfull for our future
1187,Straight forward and user friendly apps
1188,I am writing this review after one year of using coursera. All I can say thank you very much üòä
1189,I have took subscription and cancelled it before the date and the money i paid did not get refunded to me and i did not even completed any certification...i was looking for help section and is useless no help contact is given ....bad experience and no good course of interest.
1190,Very easy to use
1191,Most amazing place for my learning. But make an option where we can do book make for our favourite cources üòÑ‚úåüèª(suggestion)
1192,The app has been superb so far and it's easy to use for me! Thanks to the developers of this amazing app!
1193,Background play is not working in the current version.
1194,Why does it not ask for camera privelages when it needs it for id verification???
1195,The worst Thing is Payment option in India is very disapoited.Only accepts Credit cards. No other option.We cont able to do payment without Credit card. Please enable all Wallet and Internet banking Payment methods in India.
1196,The app keeps glitching every time. The videos glitch too after every 3 seconds. It is terrible for someone trying to learn. Worst experience.
1197,Excellent application
1198,"App isnt a substitute for its website, but compliments it greatly. One can still learn and study with the app. GREAT ONE!!!"
1199,I've been using this app to do my Google certificates. I love it. It's easy to use and navigate through.
1200,Fun to learn.
1201,Great app
1202,"Terrible experience! I have enrolled in the UX design course. It contains 7 different courses, I have completed the first one now I'm not able to access the second one. I enrolled in the 2nd one, but it keeps showing not enrolled. There is no option to start learning. I've never had such a terrible experience on a website or app. The irony is they are providing courses on better user experience but their website is designed so badly. Never been so frustrated in my entire life!"
1203,Very good app.
1204,Best one from playstore
1205,I've lost all the courses i was enrolled in. There is no email which you could use to ask for assistance. Please help
1206,Pls improve the translation all of the translation wrong
1207,"The aspiration to make quality education available and cost-friendlier is awesome, however, that one can't run the app on a cheap Android tablet is quite frustrating; I mean, hiring some CSS guy to develop a landscape orientation for your app in Android tabelts wouldn't cost as much, maybe?! and I guess lots of students have a tablet/laptop than a desktop?!"
1208,Amazing
1209,Great app and convenient but flashcard exercises are not working well on my android device which is weird.
1210,Poor review system Your efforts arent important Prople doesnt check whats inside Useless certificate Wasted my money on this thing
1211,"New update not that good, liked the previous version as we are able to see the total quiz, practice quizz,number of assignments."
1212,"Great app for learning. lecture are awesome, clear and to the point . But faced issue after downloading video . They start lagging. Please resolve this issue."
1213,Amazing app
1214,Good
1215,It's just keep pausing!! Please fix it!!
1216,Great app
1217,I love having access to a ton of classes. It is super easy to navigate ans empowers me to grow daily.
1218,Good very nice
1219,"Courses are too expensive as compared to ""UDEMY""."
1220,Best
1221,"Really annoying. Courses I have completed still read ""Enroll"". Videos keeps stopping."
1222,I tried your app (the course about Rome architey) and found that text fields work incorrectly. The text in them is oriented from right to left and change uppercase chars to lovercase and viseversa.
1223,"No doubt, Coursera is very useful. I just want the highlighting of transcripts (making notes) to be present in App Version."
1224,"Videos quality is much worse than on the website, even when choose highest quality. Very limited setting options. And for some reason, this app keep draining phone battery even not in used."
1225,"The most user-friendly, the most up-to-date, and intuitive learning platform, where every course is a treat !"
1226,The app is good especially when using it offline
1227,Very helpful and affordable. It has helped me to gain better knowledge as well as certificates from well renowned institutes. I am really thankful to coursera for giving us such opportunities to learn new skills so smoothly.
1228,It is Good
1229,Fantastic
1230,"I think app runs very slow not able to take the user input . The videos in the app are also lagging for every 2 seconds and it takes another 2 seconds to resume , it takes 3times more time than the actual length of the video , website also have same problem , It takes more time to load and takes very much time to respond after clicking. Plz solve the problem we are not able to see the videos , it will cause our education"
1231,Shi hai yaar. No complaints
1232,Its good app I like it
1233,The button continue doesn't work dear .
1234,Pretty good
1235,I love doing online courses on Coursera.
1236,4 star for the contents. 1 star for the application
1237,Nice app
1238,Easy to learn courses
1239,Good app for student's
1240,"Great value. Cannot find better information for the small monthly fee anywhere. Studyng at your own pace has been a tremendous benefit and, if you think about it, added to its already highly acclaimed position. Any time I need to refresh, or learn something new, I always start with Coursera and so should you!! Ok not sure what happened but I cannot connect or login. No updates were done until I get what I am paying for the rating goes to 1 star!"
1241,The best resource for online learning ever!
1242,doesn't load course content
1243,Love Coursera!!
1244,Well done
1245,"This app is awful. Slow, clunky and absolutely horrible to use. Considering how good, efficient and easy to use their website is I highly recommend just to use their website to learn. Using this app is frustrating. It's a shame to see that there is no improvement is made to make this app better."
1246,This app is too buggy for me.
1247,Scammers. They take your money and you would never be able to contact them. It had happened to me so trying to make everyone aware.
1248,Not a review of course: course quality is great. The app bot web and mobile suck big time. My subscription was cancelled and course was saying inactive. When i payed again i was enrolled in wrong specialization. I had to go cancel the subscription now on my dashbord my correct subscription is showing. What a complete waste of 1.5 hours of time on a weekend. No customer care number to talk to. No trouble shooting method for typical issues. You are left alone with your issue. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
1249,Downloaded videos is laggy after 10 mins. Also it is overheating while playing the downloaded videos. So i am using the external players to watch the downloaded videos. Please fix this out.
1250,Searching a particular type of course is difficult.if u add a filter menu it will be better
1251,"The completed course should show completed instead of enroll. Didn't show current course in the specialization, it always show from the first course. Cannot contact support or send request on web. the course should show the time it release or what and when it is updated. Thanks."
1252,"BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE. My daughter registered for a 11 week course and we made payment. After 3 weeks, she was unable to see the course progress and her Id is disabled and we have lost our money. No way to reach people who manage the application and site. I suggest everyone to please beware of this app and site."
1253,Very best
1254,So nice
1255,One of my favorite apps to use in 2021
1256,Good app
1257,"The app keeps telling me that I'm offline, meanwhile I have a really good connection."
1258,"few substantial courses available these days, compared with what used to be offered. My quizzes completed while offline are not submitted when i get online. the data seems to have been lost. there is no way to submit feedback in the app."
1259,My coursera account is not working properly in my mobile.it is not possible to me access my course many times from learn tab even though i had registered to it.can you please fix it.
1260,Really good to be what to be Nice app I will take courses and specializations from this platform

1263,Wow
1264,"Sangat membantu dalam proses belajar online dimanapun, dengan fitur yang sangat mendukung meskipun free"
1265,Amazing App! Love the courses! But it would be better if they could decrease the prices a little. More & more people will join..
1266,"Camera doesn't work, camera didn't ask permission to work to validate my ID."

1268,Good I like it !!!
1269,I like how we can download every lecture videos along with subtitle and moreover almost every course is flexible and I dont have to worry about dead lines. This app is really great for freshers who are just entering the corporate world.
1270,Great app
1271,Can't reply my question on this app
1272,How to mirror it on TV screen ?????????????
1273,My courses page never loads after the latest update. I'm always forced to use the website on my laptop
1274,Worth it. Numerous options and quick access to study materials.
1275,I am trying to send my assignment but the typing keyboard and when uploading my assignment ..the page keeps cracking..I dont know what's happeningüò≠ I love this app
1276,Enjoying using this to take various university courses.
1277,The app is really great. However it would be nice if they could include a dark theme.
1278,Best learning app
1279,Dear Coursera its really a cheap way to take others people money by making the auto subscription on default! I am really pissed off that was the last money that I had and now I am completely broke! Thanks to you who only teaches ethics but not apply it!
1280,Hard to get or find some courses.
1281,I wish we had a kind of wish list of courses were interested in so it's earlier to find them after idk if it's me and idk how to do it

1284,Best learning app
1285,Good app

1287,"Claim "" free enrollment "" , but when you try to enroll, you are forced to a pay page or 7 day free trial page, NO OPTION TO CONTINUE TO ENROLL FOR FREE OR PROXY THE COURSE, NONE, LIES !!!. These types of practices should be illegal."
1288,"It's a great, useful application, especially downloading lectures, but when I saw the script of the lecture I discovered that The app does not support the translation as well as the website, which has made it very difficult for me to complete the course. Please fix this problem As soon as possible and I appreciate this great effort ,thanks"
1289,Excellent ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1290,"Very slow app and web, spammy (and hard to unsub), horrible free content (makes you lose hope (stop looking for meaningful reasons to enroll) in universities from the content of courses provided/available)."

1298,Great app. My one concern is the lack of responses from support. Finished a course but haven't been able to verify my ID for months
1299,"The app for phone is not useful, not everyone have a laptop to view most parts of the courses, but still want to learn."
1300,"It's very good , i like using it and learning different things from it , It has good different courses in different aspects, generally GOOD"
1301,Thanks a lot for developing this.
1302,Helps for building your CV
1303,"Great overall, Text area needs some checking, thumbs up team"
1304,"Damn!! I could've rated it 5 stars.I graduated with highest scores [GPAs] but didn't get my Certificate, it is indeed a learning field with variety of modified, profound work. My professor [instructor] congratulated me upon my achievements and later told me to BUY THE CERTIFICATE. I'm so disappointed üôÅ asf. I mean, I thought it was ‚Äúfree‚Äù Maybe that word [free] has lost its meaning"
1305,Worst app i have ever seen
1306,Good
1307,"Although I've been enjoying the courses and assignments, the app itself is pretty terrible. I usually have to refresh several times to find the class and then after watching the videos, the app doesn't register that I've watched them. Additionally, I can't see my graded/reviewed work or review my peers' work on the app- I have to go to a computer to do that. Since I don't have easy access to a computer (only tablets and phones), I feel uncertain about whether I want to take more courses."
1308,"This has more downs than basketball plays when they twist their ankles. Broken, Useless, better off not even existing. Apparently, that's the main genetic you inherited from your parents."

1319,I have enrolled for a course from my institute. Now I can't access the course's second part assignments although it is showing enrolled status. Please help.
1320,The app was fine a 6 months ago. Now the downloaded videos are lagging while playing. Its very much difficult to watch such Laggy videos. Please fix this. And make the app a bit more optimised.
1321,Good app for education
1322,No one reviews any assignments after 1 year
1323,Some this app is loading
1324,Great
1325,"It's educational and moreover, it's free. 10/10 would recommend."
1326,Great.
1327,Bad
1328,"The ""Explore"" button on desktop version is super annoying as every time I hover over it opens an unavoidable and crazily wide menu that makes me accidently click on a random link almost every time. Just trying to finish a course here, don't force us to click on EVERY courses that you have. The courses are great, the menu is upsetting."
1329,Great app
1330,Recent update is very bad. Its realy hard to open a course. Courses loading time is also increased
1331,"App is worst, It's always stop working between video's and my network speed always slow down when I start coursera app."
1332,"Course duration is showing less when compared to google. For example:- financial markets is showing 28 hours duration in this app but in google its showing approxmately 33 hours. English for career development its showing 21 hours in this app but its showing 40 hours in google. Like that all the courses are showing less duration in app. I calculated courses hours, google is showing right duration."
1333,"Dear developer, payments are failed at the time of subscribing Google's project management certification course, please resolve this issue."

1341,"Downloaded videos starts laging after 5 min of watching, and even this app takes to kuch time to actually display what courses i have subscribed and other pages. And this app most of the time crashes. But the on thing good about this app is it provides offline support but that feature is buggy and a bit of laggy too."
1342,Nice and excellent app..thank u guys
1343,"Do NOT do it. They know perfectly well the failure rate for students is high and their certificates hold no real life value, unlike your real life money, wasted here. Idk where all the money they get from gullible students goes, but it isn't toward creating a successful learning platform, aside from successfully making it three times more difficult than it has to be to delete your account. Walk away and go cancel your gym membership. If you do what you love you won't procrastinate."
1344,I didn't get any certificates even I passed and completed complete course
1345,Great app offering so much invaluable content!
1346,Please resolve the bugs

Everything was going well but suddenly after the free trial the course disappeared from my account. Even though I haven't cancelled tbe course, it shows to be cancelled. Now that I'm trying to repay to continue my study, I'm unable to make the payment, it shows that there's some error. Please guide me through this."
1353,Doesn't have an option to list only Coursera plus courses.
1354,What an educational application! I always ace my skills from this site. I get knowledge more than what I expect from the site
1355,"Hi. Thank you very much for developing a mobile app for Coursera, which has helped me a lot in my professional life. I would like to give it 5 stars, but there's an issue the developers need to fix. I can watch lectures in different qualities depending on my network connection, but when I try to download them for later offline use, the videos are downloaded in HD and this consumes lot of mobile data as well as phone storage. Please fix this and let us download lectures in low quality as well."
1356,I love Coursera They are the best

1362,Good
1363,Very educational for higher learning
1364,"I wish the app loaded faster. A feature which would let us watch videos from where we last left off would be super helpful, both on the app and website. The reading sections get automatically completed even though I didn't finish them. On the website, I can just mark the section completed. Coursera should introduce this feature to their app as well. Overall, I'm quite happy with the lectures and practice exercises. They have an amazing catalogue of courses. I love using Coursera!"
1365,Keren abis

1379,No certificate at all waste of time
1380,"I wish there were more accessibility features. For example, I'd like to change the appearance of the CC. This app isn't great for diverse learners. Also full screen video cuts off the edges of the video. Being able to download the course content to my phone/tablet is great since I don't have wifi at home."
1381,Easy to use and straight forward learning hub..

1389,Very good platform for students to build skills on their professional fields. Thanks for coursera for great opportunity to build my skill.

1418,I am currently taking the course Introduction to Personal Branding and in that course there's some places to write my name and opinion and when I try to write it shows letters in backwards and it's annoying. I can't fully get involved in this course just because of that. Please make it right.
1419,"this is probably the only famous app i tried that doesn't show you progression bar when you're downloading a video, i actually can't even tell if my videos are being downloaded or not, if there is a problem in my connection, or with the server in my country i wouldn't even know because the app doesn't even bother to show me something like ""25mp of 90mp"" when im downloading (there is some other issues with downloading but i can only write 500 letters here)"
1420,"It is a wonderful app and I am having a very good experience with it, but I would love you guys to add a feature like a cart were we can select some certain courses we plan to work on and keep them in a cart to help us remember easily as sometimes it's difficult to find all the courses u had in mind to work on"

1428,"It's better if you use it on a regular laptop or desktop computer but using it on a tablet or iPad or any mobile device you won't get the same satisfaction you would get on a laptop or desktop computer. I have had my share of issues using it from my Android app on my tablet. If you can, use it on a computer."
1429,Bad experience on interacting with the app. Bugs and courses quizes I ssues must be solved
1430,Good but on my phone there is no way to save a course to my wishlist. Shame because there are many I would like to do.

1449,Coursera is one of the best learning platform I've come across and I really appreciate the MOOC intiative to reach on a global scale. I wish if I just knew about it before that would have been great. I'm very thankful to all the people who made existence of such courses available.
1450,Best learning app
1451,It consume a lot of megabytes
1452,This app is an absolute distress . I had signed up for Google data analytics and suddenly I got out of it even though I did nothing and it showed I had to sign up again for the course . R u ready to give money again for other's nonscence ? And payment method suddenly said error and help Cantre . Please don't get me started on the help centre . Worst help centre I have come across. None to talk or message to . Do you people think that the customers are dumb sheep or what ?
1453,Can't see my in progress courses
1454,Brilliant
1455,"In spite of having good internet, it always shows no connection avalable. Connect with internet."
1456,"Great teacher & material, but people flood the user forum with requests for early peer grading instead of waiting their turn. Sadly as a result, users quickly give up using the forum to help each other with course questions - meaning if you get stuck there's no one to help you. Policy says they will remove repeat offenders but they didn't. I originally planned to take several other courses but changed my mind because this significantly impedes learning & diminishes the whole course experience."
1457,Coursera is absolutely fantastic for learning new things that can be used professionally. The option to audit the contents first and pay later is very useful. I thank the makers of Coursera for it.
1458,top quality courses

1475,"Videos don't play smoothly. After playing a video for a while, it starts to lag and becomes very irritating. Closing the app and reopening removes the problem.

1476,Great app
1477,"Thank you very much Coursera. I have learnt so much from your free to audit

1501,"Works well for reading and watching videos. Not so much for quizzes and other practice code entry. Code entry for practice blocks is too small. There's a lot of unused space, but the UI always presents the code entry in a tiny, half-inch-tall box. If that wasn't bad enough, coding portions of quizzes don't work at all. So, instead of having a tiny box, you get no box; how am I supposed to pass my quizzes if I can't answer the questions?"
1502,Nice app üëå
1503,Great
1504,Love this app! From Afghanistan
1505,"The Coursera website is the best online learning platform I have ever seen. App has good functionality, but the performance is not good. Does not load the courses I enrolled on the home view."
1506,I enjoy this app ! This is so useful for me to learn Korean Language. Thank you so much.
1507,They tell you for free until you sign up.
1508,I installed this app for korean learning and I was really enjoying the classes but when I reached 2nd module it stopped midway... videos won't load even if I have good internet connection..it says the check your internet connection and just keeps on buffering but won't start. Please fix this issue because I really want to continue learning on this app.
1509,All good but typing in discussion forum impossible in app. It only works on pc.
1510,"This app and coursera page is sooo slow to load. Even more - A user doesn't land you on hers last course place, it lands on completely irrelevant page (which has some enrollment info or encorages her to edit her profile) The video even on Android have too much ""oops something went wrong"" ... I'm curious, who was the architect of this solution. (never to hire) I'm not sure why.it takes soo much longer then by other course providers. It is a pity."
1511,"Ease of use, and convenient"
1512,"It is best, skills from this helped me getting a intern."
1513,Coursera is the bestü§©üôåüèª
1514,Great app
1515,One of the best for self development
1516,"The worst app which gives you login issues and the payment is debited unknowingly, careful my fellow buddies who download this app. Best is not to enroll and subscribe it."
1517,Takes too much time in loading 'My courses'
1518,Became all about money üí∞
1519,The app is really good for learning a lot of amazing stuff..I'm currently taking courses but Coursera has made online learning experience amazing for me. It's really awesome üòÅ
1520,Please give accessibility options for things like font size.
1521,Nice
1522,That's a great opportunity to learn and understand many thing .
1523,"I had enrolled for IoT course and almost completed it. But now it is not showing my course on the app. I have completed my all the quizes as well as assignments. I was about to get certificate but that course is now not visible on the dashboard. I also tried to do it through browser, still it's not showing."
1524,Very good to learn things
1525,"As, a mature age student. Coursers gave me the opportunity to find, and pursue a degree; so that I have a qualification that goes with the work that I do; on a day to day basis. Yours Sincerely, Derek Rocha of Melbourne VIC Australia."
1526,There is no dark mood
1527,Cool
1528,Not loading course. We paid you to learn. Fix the problem please. Do you realize how many 1 star you received. This APP is like a zombie now.
1529,U r system Just Typing my mother name on the certification that i getting ur AI are doing wrong job you must change see that issue please
1530,The best
1531,I got financial aid from ko Shera for Google data analytics course I am very thankful for them providing as I finished my foundation course and I wanted to move on I found out that other courses models were not present there and I was not able to view my my course and it is showing that you are not enrolled in any of the courses googled it checked the help center option for chat or email but trust this app is not user friendly website is also not user friendly not able to contact them
1532,App is so useful. While sleeping and randomly while getting bored I watch the courses on my cell. These are useful for many courses that don't reuqire a book and pen.
1533,Great
1534,I can't use courses offline even though I have them downloaded and I'm on the right settings. I think there should be a redesigning so one can access the courses they're on first on the homepage and also there should be a bookmarking option to videos and articles so one can revisit with ease.
1535,App and the web page always and always has login issues! No way to get around that.
1536,not good for biggners
1537,Very good app
1538,Stay away. This is a big scam operated by multi-million dollar companies.
1539,I could not continue ..didnot get materials but i like to learn
1540,I highly recommend Coursera has excellent and professional courses that helped me a lot thanks Coursera
1541,Didn't expect an online learning platform to be this Good. Kudos to you Coursera
1542,Great application
1543,"The app works fine as it is, Courses are great, but there is this problem that asks me to reset my deadline even if I don't miss them. How does this weekly system work?"
1544,üìíüëåüåè‚ù£Ô∏è‚≠êüíØüåºüíª
1545,Bad automatic refund policy would not recommend this app to anyone
1546,User friendly.
1547,The app is struggling to charge my course... :/
1548,"Worst app...funny part is I realized that the app which has Google's ux design course is full of glitches and has a very bad user experience. I use desktop to access the course. But when I tried to access the course from Coursera app in my redmi note 7 pro, I cant read articles because of black screen and blinking text, the quiz page seems full of glitches, the discussion prompt dialog ui is worst and less accessible. No organised info/commands and seems like searching for a needle in sand."
1549,Can't complete courses especially after the recent upgrade
1550,No interactive course
1551,Its been 3 days I'm trying to download Coursera. It simply shows pending or installing but doesn't get downloaded. Please fix this.
1552,I cannot talk verbally in this app to consult
1553,this app is very helpful but verfication didn't work it tell me to enable camera and in app to be enabled there isn't
1554,Awesome
1555,Its easy to use. Put ut use high celluar data. I liked the downloading feature...its work more than good.
1556,The best
1557,Great Platform to skillup your knowledge.By learning practically.....
1558,The UI is horrendous. All white and less functional than 2-3 years ago
1559,I am unable to enroll ornsubscribe. Worst app ever used
1560,Superb
1561,It stucks while playing videos(downloaded) offline after an update.
1562,App is not good and better to use website. The Android app does not allow to take notes of the transcript while watching video. At least the mobile browser version can save notes but interface not as nice.
1563,Urgent Need of Bookmark option in Coursera. Seriously it just piss of that more than 10 years of functioning of this organisation & still they didn't have a Bookmark the courses option..
1564,App not working after update
1565,Why don't you make the courses free for poor countries we can't afford it so what's the use?and you also obey politics you have blocked iranian users from getting certifications is this really education or giving degrees and money making?even if it was not about money it would be dishonest to get the certificate from other ways we can do that with a different ip and lying about the place we live in!and the 150 words you have to write for financial aid!begging for it is just not worth it!
1566,"Despite being a huge online courses platform,you guys can't even make a proper working app without bugs."
1567,Great Learning Platform
1568,Very fun!This helps me alot!I has a tone of workbooks and test!I love it!
1569,Good
1570,"I just finished a course and when I got back to the app a few hours later , it is starting right from the first . All that I completed is vanished. Very disappointed"
1571,Troubleshooting in contact with help center... It do not subscribe selected couse n shows another course subscribed. Very bad service
1572,"SCAMMING trick company alert!!! I paid to get my diploma but they never gave me that, instead they charged me again later because i was still ""enrolled"" on the course (that i paid after finished). Today i got charged again for the same reason... I never got a refund for the first one neither because even when is not my fault the site is designed to charge you and customer service representative blame you. I want to keep studying but also don't want to be scammed monthly."
1573,Excellent
1574,The video becomes static after pausing and replaying until I'm force to restart the app. Kindly check on it.
1575,"Everything is good in it.. I've done many courses from coursera till now.But the only the problm is that Financial aid approval process is toooo lengthy..it takes 15days to aprrove a financial aid which I think is too long. If it can be lessoned to 5-7 days, i feel its ok, then we can start the course earlier, otherwise we have to simply wait for its approval for 15 days!!"
1576,Best app
1577,Don't have a link to share to linkedin..
1578,Good
1579,App keeps crashing
1580,"Downloaded course gets struck (lag) sometimes, and it works even worse sometimes. I dont know why it is happening, but please fix it as soon as possible."
1581,"Bad.....I signed Up for the IT course I had problems from the beginning. Tests were saying I failed when I passed you can't Fix it because they just constantly send you to most common problems......this is a 7 day free trial you think that they would want you to be completely satisfied. When I sent an email it clearly stated "" We have no idea when this will be fixed.' WHAT?? I already cancelled my free trial so I'm going to move on to another company"
1582,"0eer review system is absolutely annoying. Just because no one reviewed my work, does that mean I didn't do it? What kind of freaked up logic is that"
1583,The app hasn't been able to connect to the internet for 2 days. I can't submit graded assignments or search for content because it's not loading. Please help because I am stuck.
1584,I am inspired to learn and advance my career.
1585,Nice
1586,It really sucks when reviewing someone's assignment. Very bad experience.
1587,Where is camera permission??? How can I do I'd verification without using camera üòíüòí
1588,"Great work Coursera... I got financial aid for courses, they gave me hope support in completing them on time. All praises to Coursera team."
1589,Pointless. No ability to verify my ID due to military service means I can't earn any certificates.
1590,All good! Evaluating with peer review should be improved.
1591,"Best learning app and I learn graphic design concepts, Digital marketing, Email marketing and English communication skills. It's very helpful my career and self development"
1592,"The app is freezing alot when i open the my courses tab and try to take any quizzes. It takes forever to load the courses. Also there's some issue with the video player, when i try to watch a pre downloaded lecture it starts to freeze again."
1593,Enable Dark Mode for Android please! My friend @Rishab has been complaining about how iOS has it and Android doesn't. Why does this injustice even exist?! Please bring dark mode ASAP before he gets glasses. I don't think he'll get any girls with glasses :(
1594,"Strongly prefer using app over desktop, but discussion forums text box is broken - it types right to left and jumps around as I type, lately, making it impossible to finish my work on the phone. Update 5/30/21: text boxes still are broken two months later!"
1595,"Perfect learning atform...but curre tky having issues submitting assignments,keepsshowing submission failed, unknown error, cant seem to fix it either."
1596,"Great app, great content"
1597,Great way of e-learning.
1598,App is very good....but iam facing problem in dowloading classes.....downloading speed is very slow despite good internet connevtion.
1599,It does not show the the course(video lectures). I got enrolled for a course but I am unable to attend the course for it does not show the week's lectures.
1600,Frustrating
1601,"Nice app but with cutted functionality. For instance, I'm unable to open labs."
1602,Best site to learning üëå
1603,The best.
1604,Best free courses
1605,Good for learning! Loving the option to download material for offline learning. App lags sometimes though.
1606,Neat application but could have a few additions such as checklist on courses' reading material and headset button playback support.
1607,App crashes frequently
1608,Great app but can you add broadcast to TV sets feature to it? it will be better to view course on 42 inch LED rather than 5 inch mobile display.
1609,Cannot delete my card it made an payment. And for the same price we can do 5-6 courses in some other application.
1610,very lagy not at all a good app
1611,"Can't do payment by Debit Card. It doesn't show more options to do payment for course except Credit card. So, I request to slove this payment problem. By this payment problem I can't learn and do any course..So , hoping this problem can be cleared very soon..like by keeping more options for payment."
1612,"Cannot sign in to the app. Cannot attend any lecture and app is just of no use as of now....i mean literally.....it was the best app i know for learning any respective skill but now, its just of no use....."
1613,"Load time is pretty slow this should be fixed as soon as possible. And just so you know, it doesnt have anything to do with my internet speed"
1614,"I noticed problems logging in and auditing courses. It's so frustrating. Previous editions have been great, but this oneüò≠üò≠üò≠"
1615,Bekar
1616,I love this app.
1617,Best
1618,"All is good except peer graded assignment system......Some peers do not even know the topic and give less marks....Some students really work hard to prepare assignments, but after submitting that assignment if illiterate peers give less marks, it really becomes frustrating for them. Assignments should be graded by respective professionals, why peers ?? I did not expect this from coursera."
1619,I cannot login with my organisational account
1620,I keep having to log in every couple of days as the app automatically forgets the user profile for some reason. The screen layout for videos is also quite questionable with most of the screen taken up by the transcript.
1621,"Distance learning has never been that much better than on this app. Very experimental and good educational app. Everyone who want better education at the highest level, wants to boost his/her resume, further career should choose this app. From professional certificate level, deploma, degree to Masters or phd should school here."
1622,It's not user-friendly. Very bad
1623,"Bad technical support. Bad graphics on certificate. I used this app to complete a course on Biotechnology. After completing, I was given a certificate with disruptive logo of the university. It seemed fake. I have contacted the customer care twice . However, they have still not resolved the issue but always provide assurance. It's going to be 3 weeks and idk what to do with your assurance buddy?"
1624,"The content is great, but the UI is a bit clumsy and buggy."
1625,Amazing app and very helpful to me!
1626,It is not at all opening while applying for free trail
1627,I used to love this app. But the new update is horrible.
1628,Slow to load even on fast connections. Crashes frequently. Slow to update completion status. Has great potential though.
1629,"I love the app as it gives me another avenue to learn on the go, but one problem I have that forces me to switch back to my PC is that the app crashes when I attempt to type for a discussion prompt. I am using the Pixel 4 XL."
1630,"Academic, which is what I love about it"
1631,Good app
1632,Unable to play videos on mobile and type answers for quiz on mobile.....very buggy app
1633,Best app to learn korean!! I definatily recommend downloading this app. Great experince!!
1634,I wish there is a way I can write my notes
1635,I have no problems while using this app
1636,Extremely Buggy. Crashed a couple of times. Please look into it. Thank you. Will change my review depending on improvements.
1637,"When last year I started using this app I loved it but it's not working properly now. I tried to open my app, I waited for about 5 to 10 minutes but nothing happens. My screen goes blank. This happens with me almost everytime when I tried to open my app. Please fix this issue as soon as possible."

1645,"Doesn't work correct in my phone's dark mode (Realme UI). When there's a quiz in the middle of a video, sometimes the Submit button gets stuck with ""SUBMITTING..."" and there is no way to try submitting again. I end up skipping the quiz to continue watching the video, making the quiz lose its value. If Submit wasn't successful in few seconds, show an error notification and allow submitting again. Otherwise make quiz validation offline and asynchronously update my submission in background."
1646,It is really a great app. You can learn sth new what you want to.
1647,Very nice app for learning
1648,I just started this amazing Learning App . I'm enjoying it. Looking forward to learning a lot from this Learning app. Thank youü•∞

1659,Good
1660,Good
1661,"This is one of the best platforms to learn as well as get hands-on experience. For someone in computer science, design and other related fields Coursera is a goldmine. But the app. Issues in the apps just degrade the experience. So to learn just visit the website on a pc if you can."
1662,Very good feeling
1663,"Hi team, I am unable to enroll for the course ..kindly guide me"
1664,I love it

1676,I'm love with it
1677,I wanna learn may things from here but.....the discussion forum is causing a lot of trouble it has become a stress for me.... whenever i try to write something it shuffles the letter and is really very problematic....even in the coursera website also this issue is being faced everywhereüòë plz it's my request plz fix it ...i really want to learn from here.

1683,BAKWASS APP WITH BAKWASS COURSE .UDEMY IS BEST IN LOW PRICE WITH MORE COURSES .. I AM UN INSTALL BYE BYE .
1684,Unable to process the payment even with irrespective no. Of trials and alternatives. No customer care service or support available to resolve the issue. The help center option on the app and website merely answer your queries. I really wish to pursue a few courses but this medium makes it extremely difficult and not user friendly.

1720,"Loved the latest update of UI. The courses can be navigated vertically as well as side-ways is really good. There is some problem with downloads. As I download a whole week of course video, some downloads get stuck in middle and never resumes. Is this the problem because I already have downloaded courses in GB's?"
1721,It is nice app for learning I am India I am using it since 1month quick learning app

But now I'm sorry to say,the app has become the shitties ever. It took a long time to load, you have to wait a long to reset your deadlines. Also discussion forum has turned into a real mess as everytime you want to write, it bakcspaces the word and later say, sorry for maintenance problem. So I humbly request to fix this things Please."

1743,Recent update is full of bugs.
1744,Great variety of different types of course.
1745,It is the best app to take online courses.I have taken some of the courses and completed them.The teaching method is really good. It has the facility of financial aid for those who is not capable of paying the course fee.Highly recommended this app.

1747,Videos not playing properly
1748,Not optimized for tablets with orientation always changing and pictures don't load
1749,"Nice interface for video playback but the download functionality is completely buggy. If a content is downloaded, the app starts being unresponsive and lagging. Please optimize the app's download functionality."
1750,Awesome
1751,"After the recent update, I am disappointed üòû. Now it's quite difficult to work with. Please send a new version upgrade. This interface is not user friendly."
1752,Unable to access quiz despite subscription. And payment is expected for even the content which is part of the Coursera plus subscription. Now I'm not sure what's the point of this subscription if everything stays paid.
1753,"So many bugsssssss, I can't use this app correctly"
1754,"Lots of courses for free, others for a minimal fee."
1755,ID verification is not working in this app.
1756,Nice courses
1757,Great service thanks.

1759,"There is bug in the app. Whenever I use discussion prompts it overwrite whatever I write and while typing in shows a site breakdown window and I am not able to unenroll the course which I don't want to continue to learn, even I use website for unenrolling course but doesn't work. The app really need a updates with fix all the bugs which happen from few months"

1764,Good
1765,"I like Coursera as it gives a chance to a person to learn new things.Regarding APP, I shall give my comments when I have used it for some time."
1766,I love coursera for their generosity.
1767,"I've used the IOs version of this app and it worked wonderfully. Recently I've started using the android app and it's a complete opposite. Works horrible and the ""My Courses"" tab takes from 5 to 10 minutes to load on a 100 Mb connection (I've actually clocked this and hoped it was my internet speed but I've confirmed it's not the case). I hope you can fix this app as I had a wonderful experience learning in coursera. Please make it work!"
1768,Go woke go broke
1769,Last update is worse than before. It takes lots of time to lead the courses but at last it fails.
1770,I am not able make the payment. From India
1771,Very intuitive and easy to use interface
1772,This app is the best when it comes to online learning.
1773,"Unable to sign in to account in latest update- no option available, some screen showing "" Sign up later is visible"". When clicked on it, courses window opens, but there also ""Sign in"" option is not present. Pls resolve the issue soon."
1774,useful
1775,It keeps saying I'm overdue although I'm not or did my assignment a day earlier. It's over a month and it still says I'm overdue even though I did it 3 days earlier.
1776,Please put in a way to bookmark/wishlist courses/specialisations that one is interested in. It is ridiculous that one has to audit or subscribe to a course before having it show somewhere easier to go back to
1777,Thanks for so many useful courses and the opportunity to take them for free!
1778,Amazing App
1779,This was a good app but new update turned out to be messy. I can't find my current running courses now. Please fix this.
1780,Great app
1781,Since i updated the app i am experiencing problems to get my courses and take assignments. I wish I didn't updated it.
1782,New version is terrible. It puts my current courses at the bottom of the page - the most inconvenient position!!
1783,"I always get this ""down for maintenance"" pop up whenever I try to engage in the discussion forums. Bugs outweight usefulness..."
1784,Bad version
1785,Specialization courses are brilliantly packed with good information..but payment service is bad not an easy payment mode to make transaction from India.
1786,Amazing courses speed 1.75x needed..
1787,Awesome! Easy to use and great experience with professional certificate.
1788,This is best app for learning
1789,Great accessory app for Coursera
1790,New update is totally disgusting!
1791,"No longer views me as online. Doesn't matter if I'm on Wifi, or 5G.. Doesn't matter if I'm on my Phone, or using the Chromebook app. And your Contact US page sucks for trying to get a hold of anyone to actually fix a problem.. Not very user friendly for stuff like that I'm disappointed."
1792,Was enjoying studying on the app. Till it stopped opening on my phone.
1793,"Extremely buggy site. Some quizzes frequently display overlapping text and quiz elements making it impossible to complete them. Sometimes the quizzes don't even load, essentially wasting your attempt to take the quiz unless you log in on a PC before time expires. On top of that, some of my enrolled courses are not showing up, leading to me having to search for them individually to resume them. And some of the courses I have finished don't say so when highlighted (still says ""enroll now"")."
1794,I am on the last lap of a course and to submit the final assignment is proving difficult. It keeps saying error. I just upgraded the app. What's going on?
1795,Completely amazing all courses free!
1796,"I have been using the app for about 3 years now and honestly, I enjoyed it at first but now, it does not load my courses. I have to wait minutes and minutes before my courses will load. It was not like this before. It was swift and very comfortable at first but not anymore"
1797,awesome. please add other languages
1798,No live customer support. Very poor service.
1799,Hell with coursera there is no proper service provided for students to explain their problem regarding assignments and for every reply the new costumer service personnel is assigned that means you have to explain the whole problem once again. which makes students frustrated.
1800,"The latest update is an absolute horror. Completed courses in specializations appear in the central page, which means I have to scroll to the right unnecessarily to find the course that I want to continue. Please roll back this update and re-introduce the previous layout!"
1801,All are paid courses go to hell
1802,"I didn't attend the course and they took 2 or 3 months money from my husband's bank accout,really very sad."
1803,with the last update i don't understand which courses i completed. The previous version was better
1804,Great. Thanks.
1805,Degree courses are inaccessible from app after last update. Some of the bugs haven't been resolved since forever.
1806,How can I 'reset deadlines' to my courses in the new update? I cant it. Please guide. All the inline sources are telling to older versiin method and not the new one.
1807,"I am not liking the new updates on Coursera. I have been using this app since 2020 after pandemic and really appreciate the efforts of Coursera team. But kindly please change the current updates , the older one was better. I have to search for my course and now it's getting difficult to find the course you left last time to continue it further. It goes to the end of the list. In addition to that I am not liking the features of suggeting courses from a university which I have opted for."
1808,"Amazing online platform for doing certification and more. Easy to accessible Recently I did google project management certification from coursera,it's awesome experience üëå"
1809,There's plenty of room for improvement
1810,"No dark theme, no good rating."
1811,This New Update is Looking Very Messy .. please bring back old UI‚ù§Ô∏è
1812,I want a place for the learners to chat with our self.
1813,It really provides quality education with high class universities and great professors from all over the world. Great initiative by the Coursera team.
1814,"I have enrolled for a course of content marketing and some videos have podcasts attached to it. But i cannot find the option of attachments in the app, even after i followed the given instructions. Please help me with this."
1815,Its the best onlin learning platform :)
1816,"Please revert to previous sorting pattern, that is newly subscribed courses show first in the list."
1817,I have used online education apps and platform. Coursera's content so far is the best
1818,"CLOWNS! I signed up for a marketing course, and halfway through I was unable to access the readings. Therefore I was unable to progress with the course. I asked for a refund of THE PREVIOUS MONTH ONLY, as I didnt want to pay for a lost month because of a technical problem that they were taking their time to fix. Now my entire course is marked ""inactive"" and I seemingly lost progress in my course. On top of that their support page is BROKEN, and their community page is also BROKEN, so their support team is inaccessible. CLOWNS"
1819,Awesome app
1820,Nice.......
1821,"I really wish I could give this app a higher rating. Pros -Good in a pinch if you have no other options to work on lessons. Cons -Automatically marks sections as completed even if you have not finished them, making it confusing to figure out where you left off. -Type is very small and thin in text sections with bright white background and hard to read. -No support options for students with learning disabilities. (Same for the phone apps and website.) -Poor customer support."
1822,"Love this app, it's nice to listen to the videos as I'm making my long commute daily. Very smooth playback, no issues"
1823,Once you sign up there doesn't seem a way to cancel subscription.
1824,The great app I never had üòÉ
1825,"Coursera is revolutionary. I love that this exists, I've learned so much through this app without having to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars. I hope the program continues to expand!"
1826,"This app misses several things that are present in the website, but what I miss most is the option to pay a course with PayPal - I can do it from the website but not in the app. This is a major issue for people like me, uncomfortable with credit cards. However, as long as I can use both I can live with this"
1827,Great learning avenue. Courses are very informative
1828,Course not connection to the internet
1829,It's a Great platform for online learning and the improvement of the app accessibility made the learning experience more smoothly
1830,"Love Coursera, don't love this app! Trying to type into any text boxes (e.g. discussion prompts or assignments) makes your text come out backwards and you can't backspace. I've been having to type it in my phone's Notes app and then copy/paste into Coursera. Also, not possible to take notes on videos like you can in the desktop app. Much better to just access your courses on the computer."
1831,Awesome experience
1832,Good learning app
1833,"I wish there was an option to save courses that you don't want to--or cannot--enroll in that course yet, so you can still remember and go back to it later."
1834,I love the app. It is great. But I would like to suggest a feature of addidng courses I like in favorite section. And there were minor bugs. But everything else is fine.
1835,Fantastic Application
1836,It's a great App. Thanks coursera for teaching me a lot!
1837,App works slowly
1838,Very bad experience till now I have enrolled for a course and added a credit card but after free trial my course has been unsubscribed and payment is not processing at all with any type of card.

1845,ü§©
1846,I was billed after my 7 day trial had expired without notification and couldn't even get a refund. I didn't complete any course during this time or commit to taking a course. I wouldn't recommend this service.

1878,"I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but for some reason, the same question that's been asked and answered in a previous section is being asked in other sections. It shows the response I've already given as well."
1879,"I selected a career path in ""Recommended"" section to check courses for that particular career. But when I wanted to go back and select another career path, I couldn't remove the selected option. Please add a feature so that we can select or remove career paths according to our interest. Also I want to see all the courses for which I searched. But I can see only 3 courses at a time. Please consider handling this issue too."
1880,"First, very slow when fetching course weeks. Second, can't show clearly what is the current resolution of videos. Third, video speed and resolution aren't saved so must be set every next video. Fourth, no easy way to save video snapshot in full screen."

1893,There should be an option for adding to wishlist.
1894,"Love the app. But why does it pause the video on its own? There's no pop up question, it just pauses after playing for a few minutes... I was trying to listen to the video while my hands are occupied. Had to resume it from pausing many times throughout a video is frustrating."
1895,"coursera is very disgusting, it is very hard to get help. they just want to charge you and get money."
1896,Such a horrible app..as u switch to different phone for payment..either it gonna increase the price of your desired course or increase the week time eventually.. üòí
1897,I was completed successfully one course that contains free certificate but i wouldn't received yet... What to do?

1904,"When using the app on a 16:10 device, the app stretches the video so that the height of the video matches the height of the device, causing the video to be cropped, which is the absolute WRONG thing to do"

1915,"Looks nice, but constant ""Oops something went wrong"" when trying to watch video lectures or ""retry can't load your data"" on courses makes this pretty annoying to use."
1916,The application overall experience is good. I have two issues when using on tablet 1. It doesn't support landscape mode in reading and quiz sections. 2. The mathematical equations doesn't display probably in quizes like it does on the web.
1917,Awesome App
1918,Best app ‚ù§Ô∏è

1936,This is an absolutely amazing platform for people who want to improve themselves. It's stunning to see that such wisdom and techniques are available for free. Truly commendable.
1937,You can not get ahold of anyone for questions. They continued to take pay.ents out after I already canceled my subscription and I have no one to talk to about a refund for this. For 2 months this has been happening. I canceled twice. I am trying a third time but i am worried I may have to cancel my bank card.
1938,Please put a few ads here and there
1939,"I'm a Coursera learner. So of course I find it good for my studies.. because there's offline learning system.

'Bangladesh'..but the writing is appear like..""hsedalgnab""...so it's really inconvenient for me"
1940,"They clearly advertise their pricing ""per month"" but their ""month"" turns out to be 28 days. And if you cancel before the cycle ends (as everyone would do obviously) then the ending date isn't displayed anywhere in your account, you need to contact them to know it. Utterly ridiculous. The content can be great thought, but the experience is just stained by their shady business practices."
1941,Every payment option I have used gives an error on the app as well as the website. Very poorly made app.
1942,No dark mode and UI is not user friendly

You try to open it, you get the launch (splash) screen, that's where it stops, for reasons I can't explain, it just stays there until you're tired and just quite it. I resorted to using the browser to take my course, which the display isn't nice because it wasn't design for small screens. I hope they'll be able to check and correct this,"
1995,"I love web version but the app has a lot of bugs. Sometimes I can't even watch the videos because app immediately get me out.

2000,The ap worked great when I started googles It course and I would have finished if the course would have worked on the mobile üì±phone instead of forcing me to go to desktop to go thru parts of the content. I was really enjoying it and need to be able to grab 5 minutes here or a half hour here to learn instead of being chained to my desktop. Its probably mostly google fault but with all the tech hoopla google and coursera could have made it so much easier to enhance the learning experience. Honest
2001,So Gorgeus Course Online
2002,The course on medieval magic and the 'nonjudgemental' examination of the subject is definitely very narrowly focused on placing blame on Christianity for it being thought of as different or evil. There are hebraic laws which are much older than the arrival of Jesus and the rise of Christianity. It seems that this course is biased and shortsighted without mentioning that 'magick' practices have always been seen in this way according to ancient scripture.
2003,"Why is the financial aid only from site, not from the app?"
2004,Cannot sign in!!!
2005,Payment options for India website and India app are horrible. Payments are accepted only through cards even though the website advertises net banking as payment option.None of the card gets verified inspite of entering all correct details.
2006,Must have for everyone
2007,Good way of Learning app
2008,Impossible to download anything even with the best internet possible.
2009,Total waste .. you cannot do some particular things on the phone app .you cannot review your peers through phone. The app developer needs to find a course on coursera first .
2010,All I get from this app is messages saying the course can not be completed with the app. Pointless.
2011,Excellent
2012,"when i put in my answers for quiz i check the results and the answer are all different. i tried to get in contact with coursera and no reply from them. how do i get my answers in and make them count, the reason i put this in the review section is i cannot get in contact with anyone."
2013,This app just make people fool I have completed one course with 91% but they still didn't issue me any certificate they are asking me to buy certificate. Before starting the they said the course is completely free of cost and certificate will be provided freely after completion. I have mailed Coursera but I didn't get any response from them.
2014,"Aside from a few assignments that you need to do on a PC, everything else works perfectly."
2015,"Payment method available is cradit card only. In India but everyone owns a credit card. Could you please start accepting payment through debit card or other digital payment method: Google pay, Phone Pe, PayTM etcetera. Thank you."
2016,"Coursera is a great for learning. The only problem I ever had was my peer assignment not being assigned a score, that really sucked considering its needed to complete a course. Everything else is really great, especially having access to a learning tools mostly free."
2017,Great!
2018,Great
2019,Good
2020,Overall it was grt experience with some knowledge
2021,Really good
2022,Wow!!
2023,Credit card should never be the only option. There has to be a google play option!
2024,In the dark mode texts are black which makes impossible to read . Please fix this
2025,"This app keeps forgetting login and password, unless used really really often, annoying!!!"
2026,Not enough practice or learning materials . Everything is so confusing . There is no specific book to follow . Teachers mist of the time talk about anything but the main topic .
2027,"I only just started using it and there are two things that instantly bothered me, 1. Not being able to resize font when reading, which is an essential feature in any app that involves reading. 2. Media playing speed should have smaller step that .25, .5 step would be way better and efficient."
2028,Where do I request for a desktop version???
2029,This is good app
2030,Always get errors when starting to play video. Still get errors after exit or reload. Stop playing videos half way without any touch. Some contents are not available.
2031,Why does it force me to use laptop ? My screen is big enough! I am using a large tablet ! Speaking of googles it cert.
2032,ÿßŸÜÿß ŸÑÿ≥Ÿá ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿπŸÖŸÑÿ™ŸáŸàÿ¥ ÿ®ÿ≥ ÿßÿ∫ŸÑÿ®Ÿäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ≥ ÿ®ŸäŸÇŸàŸÑŸàÿß ÿßŸÜŸàÿß ÿ≠ŸÑŸà ÿ¨ÿØÿß
2033,"As an educational service, it is great. As an app, needs improvement with loading course materials (still buggy, particularly for low-internet devices)."
2034,"Great ‚ú® No matter if your pursuing education or not , you can learn and explore your favourite topics across seas , some courses are free while some has to be subscribe . I'm loving it ü§û"
2035,Very useful for me.
2036,Great app I pray I get more time to study
2037,Coursera is the best online platform for students and researchers to learn and improve their skills.
2038,Please don't waste your time downloading this nonsense app. I tried to do a course for free and they were trying to force me into buying the course by saying that of I want to get the results of my Quiz I will have to pay for it. Please fix this issue and make the app better.
2039,"Please review your app and website, why are they not working while we are on the middle of completing courses, aargh"
2040,Great Educatiin App!
2041,I would have appreciated a dark mode in the app. Very informative and interesting courses.
2042,"Hey Coursera Since the last update, not able to access the online content. Do resolve!"
2043,Perfect
2044,Amazing app for learning
2045,There are heating issues on Poco M2 Pro while using the Coursera App... Please resolve this soon...
2046,"Highly disappointing to not find any medium to communicate for help. When there is payments involved it makes it difficult to be always directed to FAQ, there should at least be an email ID for any concern"
2047,Helpful
2048,"It was easy to use but after the latest update, not able to login at all :(."
2049,Coursera needs to let us block discussion post notifications without also blocking deadline notifications. There is like thousands of people taking this course so the discussion post notification goes off every hour.
2050,Worst one I completed 16 courses for free but I didn't received my certificates when I verifiy my id they said some error
2051,It is very Useful App for the Students
2052,It is great. Except for the fact that I can't submit my assignments. Many are facing the same problem as mine. Hope to get the updated fixed version soon.
2053,Can't download for offline learning. Just loader spinning endlessly.
2054,Not able to change the career selected in Advance my career option. Please fix this issue.
2055,Best educational app I've used on Google Play
2056,Best app ever !
2057,wow wow wow that very good
2058,Love ‚ù§Ô∏è
2059,Not open after registration. As well as required ATM detail. I am satisfied from this app No free app
2060,Fake ads in FB
2061,You are awesome. Learnt so much from this. Flexible schedule and auditing the courses are really helping a lot (even though if you can't afford the course) Thanks a lot Coursera ‚ô•Ô∏è
2062,I'm learning Korean and choose from Yonsei university. Those really help me alot. I'm just wish there is a continuation from First Step Korean and Learn to Speak Korean.
2063,"There are always problems with assignments, sometimes I don't get assigments, sometimes there are no assignments to review. Support team seems to be helpful, but they never really help me, they put me on other sessions, but usuallyit doesn't help. I'm tryingto finish the current specialization, but then I will look for another platform."
2064,This app is very awesome
2065,I did a course in this app and it says 0 min remaining in week one but i have completed all my weeks ( assignment nd all).
2066,False advertisers. Tried for a couple days and was liking. Was going to subscribe. But once I seen the new pricing. 6x more expensive and locks you into a year contract. Don't bother with it. Can get free class at your local education institutions own MOOC systems. These are well put together but not worth it at price they are at. Won't ever use or recommend again without a monthly plan available again. 90% of users it will be 70% wasted money .
2067,Great
2068,Greatest app
2069,"App keeps on crushing, fail to open the downloaded materials"
2070,I'm very disappointed! I enrolled in a Mental Health course and paid $50.00 for it and now the app is acting like it doesn't know me. It had me sign up for an account all over again. So now what? How do I get a refund if it doesn't have any record of me? My guess is that I will have to call my bank and handle it that way unless you have a better idea.
2071,I love this app
2072,"Superb, immense, professional trainers, good quality presentation & quick certifications. Good job entire team for such superior initiative of an online [{ learning/education]} creation. Kudus to development teamüëçüòéüëèü§óüôè"
2073,Thanks for making a app
2074,That's really useful app
2075,Great app
2076,Please add dark mode to Coursera app. It is too bright for me and uses more battery.
2077,"I'm studying supply chain through Coursera but I'mnot entirely happy at all with this method of student marking our assignments,my assignment are way past due because of this method, I've marked more than 10 assignments but no one returns the favor, you posted that I must mark 3 so that my assignment can be marked but no one bothered, I've been posting before deadline on forums, meet and greet, general discussion, please can a professional lecture mark our work, now I'm on week 2 same procedure"
2078,Rather clunky and not so intuitive. Wish there's a way to mark a course as favorite so that I can go back and look later if I'm not ready to start something. So many I want to check out later but there's just no way to mark them.
2079,Totally amazing. Easy to use. Loved it. Almost all times favouriteüòç
2080,Yousuf khan
2081,"I have had an overall positive experience. Some courses are better than others, I have thoroughly enjoyed the Google IT Fundementals course. I do think it would be great if there was an option to switch the background to night mode so its not so bright while your studying at night. Thank you!"
2082,"Their is causing an error while verifying an ID. When I upload the picture of the document, it jumps to 1st page again. So please after it and please solve this problem as early as possible."
2083,This app is absolute trash. It never works. If you apply from a financial aid to do the. Course you are a jerk because they will make you so so much mad that you will not be able to find your certificate. As for me when I completed my certification they were like congrats you have achieved your certificate and blah blah blah .. the tech stuff . But the day after when I completed my course I tried my best to obtain certificate it drive me mad because they use a third party üéâ trash app persona.
2084,GREAT
2085,"This is the best app I have ever used, it makes learning very easy and exciting. Kudus to the developer"
2086,Thank you
2087,Nice application.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüëçüëåüëåüëå
2088,Best learning app for mobile.
2089,Great place t√¥ learn
2090,"Great app, but when you use it a lot, the device became so heavy"
2091,"A perfect knowledge hub through online mode, Excel the skills"
2092,Please guide me I'm unable to submit my assignment. it's showing an error. I have tried for several times.
2093,"I love this app and website. It's non-intrusive, the courses and lessons are well-designed and engaging, and the instructors are top-notch!"
2094,Add dark theme please
2095,"It looks nice at first glance, but there some major shortcomings. First, it actually does not work offline. Thus, it is almost of no use to download courses because you anyway cannot open them being offline. Second, useless ""Recommended"" page which of very low value and should be changed or augmented with ""Favorites"" section. I would definitely prefer to see the courses I found interesting instead of Coursera's recommendations. In addition, there many minor glitches that should be fixed."
2096,Nice
2097,"The app is good but I can't help but feel it's not legit for me, especially for us South Africans. Whether it recognized by our country, registered and approved for use. All these things stems from the need of that. All these studies are from overseas and has no guarantee given as proof of an international approved subjects. There are subjects I wish to study for but nothing is listed there."
2098,Very good and user friendly.
2099,"Thank you for providing us the best online courses. However, it is really hard for me to find a way to add a payment method in the app. I have tried logging in from the website (continuing with Google) but it won't log me in. I'll try to finish the course first and upgrade for the certificate later."
2100,"I like this course app, free & easy to use. One thing that I think would be very useful is wishlist course feature. I like learn many things, but I can't take it all at the same time. So, there's a moment when I want to take that course but I'm not finish yet the other course that I enrolled in. Then I have to screenshot it so I can enrolled in it in the future. Wow this is my longest review on google play. But anyway, I hope you understand what I mean. Thank you for making this great app‚ù§Ô∏è"
2101,Very good app for learning. Highly recommend.
2102,I wanted to like this app. Until you find out that a lot of things aren't available to you unless you pay for the certificate. What good is a class where I can't get feedback?
2103,I don't think so you can find better study than this on entire internet. What i like about this app that if you are a valid student you can still access the course w/o certification. Certificate is important but skill is more imp. I can't emphasize enough that how you people are revolutionizing entire education system with providing courses from world's most leading institutes. Thanks again i would have given a six stars if that were possible.
2104,The information and certificate are better than others but the app should be upgraded. Because I am experiencing very difficulties on opening my project . Every option of project does open but only overview does not.
2105,"What a joke! At first I thought this app was amazing, $40 a month for as many IBM courses as I can take. Wrong. This rip-off of an app wants to church you $40 a month per course, even after you finish it. So if I wanted to take 3 courses through IBM then it's a $120 a month even after I finish them. Don't download this app!!!!!"
2106,me cobraron sin cursar nada.. estafa
2107,I think it's batter than edx.
2108,"The courses do not load properly,"
2109,Great experience learning on Coursera
2110,Best app
2111,"Love the purpose, hate that my responses are not saved."
2112,I love this app. Theyre amazing.
2113,Amazing
2114,It helps
2115,Awesome education source at this time
2116,Very easy to use and helpful
2117,Where is forgot password option
2118,"The app is good, it it's not show the attachments. So every time i wqnt to listen toman interview, I have to use my laptop"
2119,Great learning and on point.
2120,It's a good app.
2121,There is no perfect HELP option for the students and is totally useless app.
2122,Too good
2123,Great overall. Give four cause issues. Though when colliding with them such as earlier reported delete all data from device settings and indeed reinstall from gplay. Their server mainly keeps the progresses saved.
2124,"Hi, the app worked brilliantly initially but is now blank. All the course information is no longer there."
2125,Ok
2126,Videos are not playing. Useless app.
2127,Best app I could find. Learned a lot
2128,Amazing!!!
2129,Really beneficial
2130,"Works fine. Please let the videos react to buttons on (Bluetooth) headsets, e.g. for pausing."
2131,"I can't imagin how this app is useful. To that result, Coursera app deserves thausands of stars. So, it can be defined that it is the most significant educational empowering objectives and goals in the world.‚ù§üß°üíõüíöüíôüíúü§éü§ç"
2132,Videos are not playing correctly. There is some problem with newer version.

2137,Very useful
2138,App is not working in my phone kindly look for it..
2139,Poor app of EXCELLENT skill platform
2140,I cant neither log in nor register.
2141,Edit 21-02-2021: The courses are not downloading. Kindly look into it.
2142,It's so niceeeeeee‚ù§Ô∏è
2143,Very useful application
2144,Why coursera is promoting certain banking & payment institutions/methods. Kindly make it universal as I felt challenging. If need any consultancy do tell.
2145,I want to ask you about the coursera website.. Because i couldn't open it in my browser even I've erase my cookie etc. Is it something wrong with coursera? or I can still access coursera by apps? thank you.. I really appreciate if you can answer it.
2146,"Cannot login into app. When password is correct it says to check network connection, when password is incorrect - it says to check login/password. It needs to be fixed."
2147,Quizzes in the courses are not opening. It keeps loading and the main quiz shows error message on opening even though the Internet connection is good. How to fix this issue?
2148,Coursera is best. Learned a lot
2149,Good
2150,One of the best and the most prestigious online learning app
2151,I'm using a Lenovo M10 HD tablet. Viewing videos on landscape mode crops the right and left side so some details are missing. I know that it's not a full HD tablet but in other apps I use videos adjusts automatically but the Coursera app doesn't. Please üôè fix it. Thank you. Great courses by the way.
2152,It's good
2153,I really like the interface of the app but what's the point of giving an app when it asks to open desktop or laptop for certain contents.
2154,Love the app! The best by far. Just have one problem and I would love to have a solution. I started a course as a free version no certificate though later when finished I could change and pay for one but that option apparently is not available :-( Please help üòÉ
2155,I love it
2156,Great
2157,It's too good and have good professional courses will help in the getting job ready
2158,Too much $$$!
2159,The app is well designed and it has the best courses
2160,Nice app for online courses.

2162,HELP US IDENTIFY THE RIGHT TOPICS. HELP US IDENTIFY THE RIGHT TOPICS. HELP US IDENTIFY THE RIGHT TOPICS. HELP US IDENTIFY THE RIGHT TOPICS. they spam you endlessly without a way to turn it off
2163,Best application for learning professional courses to get skills and knowledge. Which will be beneficial for life. Anyone who wants to learn professional courses and to get skills must visit coursera. I have learned a lot of thing from this application.
2164,Amazing platform I learned so much from coursera. Thanks coursera üëç
2165,Groomed me a lot.. Thanks for everything

2169,Simply perfect
2170,"The courses are definitely good but I hope that Coursera will provide free courses with certification, this will really change our society and all people around the world will have access to this great content."
2171,Interface could be improved
2172,"Hey Dev I'm unable to go through any of the course. Everytime I tap on a course video to play it crashes. Showing me the warning as ""Coursera app has stopped working"". Then I reported several times with log. But nothing seemed to work. Even with the course I already downloaded on my phone. My Device- Redmi note 8. Os - MIUI 12 build on top of Android 10. Running on security patch of January 01 2021. Please look at problem and fix ASAP."
2173,"REPLY ASAP I really used to like this app but since a while now, when i enroll in a course and then go access it, there is no content in any week. My network is great, and the search feature works too. When i went on to explore the status if the course has been removed, it wasn't, but just started. I am doing MOOC for my upcoming sem exam to be at equal grounds with my peers. So plz fix it fast if you can or i'll have to re-search a course that completely fits me all over again, another site."
2174,"URGENT! For some reason the app shows stories of The Creative Writing Course cutoff on the app... I went to the full site to be able to read, or else I was going to misjudge the assignment as incomplete. Please don't make excuse that you already put a warning about the big screens, you need to be specific and clear to tell people that texts may not be fully shown on the app. Inacceptable, I was going to upset someone maybe. Thanks God I have a mind."
2175,Amazing. Learning at it's peak.
2176,Can't pay from PayPal or Credit card from the app.
2177,I don't have a credit card.

2179,Love it
2180,"Charged during free trial and there's nothing about that in the help center, also can't speak to anyone about it, there are only FAQs."
2181,Learner's best companion
2182,Fantastic
2183,"I started a class. I almost finished the class. Upgraded membership. Now can't submit assignment, which means no certificate. Contacted support. Told it was difficult to fix. They offered to refund my money. How does that help? I already gave them money for several months prior working on the same certificate. They won't say when it will be fixed. Really? Stay away, unless you don't mind wasting time and money."
2184,"Buenos d√≠as, me gusta la aplicaci√≥n, sin embargo tengo que entrar desde el port√°til porque desde el celular me dice que no tengo internet y esto no es verdad, dado a que entro a otra app y s√≠ tengo WiFi, me gustar√≠a que resolvieran o se comunicaran conmigo para saber que puedo hacer para que funcione desde el celular porque es m√°s f√°cil para m√≠ estudiar desde el cel."
2185,many bugs in that version. i m gonna try this atualization and so i return for other rate.
2186,OK
2187,Worst app I have ever seen. I can't tell you a time when this app does not freeze it closed itself more than 6 times since I downloaded it 15 minutes ago. I don't know what is wrong with this app.
2188,"Stole my fb account and said it was an error. It says it doesn't work on Lolipop below but downloadable in KitKat!? Edit: Always doesn't work, I logged in my Google instead but it would seem the downloading always getting halted and doesn't get downloaded... Enrolled but it is always so slow."
2189,It is the best among the better
2190,"BE VERY CAREFUL about the subscription model if you are doing only a single course, it will continue to charge you after you have completed the course if you do not cancel the subscription. Good app to pick up skills and learn, just wish the payment model was clearer."
2191,Awasomeüî•
2192,Good
2193,Thank You üòä Coursera Team üôèüôèüôè
2194,Absolutely great!!
2195,Awesome
2196,After the latest update I'm not able to log in to my account
2197,It's good at first but now whenever I tried to explore the courses it always has trouble loading the data
2198,Couldnt log in
2199,Great opportunity for learning
2200,there's something wrong with the practice quizzes!!
2201,I hate this app it never open fastly.
2202,"Please stop writing ""Enroll for Free"" next to courses that turn out to be paid subscriptions with a credit-card-required 7-day free trial."
2203,Awesome program to learn a new language for free if you don't want to get the certificate.
2204,Video always lags no way to complete the course with this app
2205,I dont have words to Express how good this app is....simply i just love this app
2206,"It takes around 10 seconds to load My Courses every time I go there (i.e. not only the first time). Moreover, the videos are all slightly zoomed in and I miss bits of slides at the edges of the screen."
2207,Good
2208,Helped me to open a lot of doors in my professional journey. Thank you!
2209,"Woow I hadn't seen any app to learn whatever stuffs like coursera, so if you're searching for knowledge this is your best choice. I love this app, I don't change it for anything."
2210,Very. Nice
2211,It's a great idea. I found that was working too much to use it. And then the flood came. An alternate name for this app might be Spamera. What ever happened to simple common-sense? Perhaps someone should offer a class in that.
2212,Good for the online learning üëç and this is about a speeking corse
2213,"In this latest update, it is showing so many lag in downloading videos, keeps on hanging and some freezes the phone."
2214,Good
2215,"Wonderful Wonderful opportunities ü•∞ I am so greatful to this application! I have learned so many amazing and helpful things from this course it is unbelievably cheap to get these accredited certificates! ( financial aid available), plus you can audit most courses for free!! I have been approved 2ce for financial aid so far!) And I am extremely greatful to courera for that! If you want to know if this app is ligit....... YES DOWNLOAD IT NOW!! ‚ù§‚ù§Seriously Thank You So Much Coursera‚ù§‚ù§"
2216,"Amazing app! Coursera has provided a lot of knowledge in fields of programming, data structures, algorithms and IoT."
2217,This interesting.
2218,"Whenever i try to log in, there is no response whatsoever when i click the login button. Please address this issue."
2219,"App not working, cant login. Able to login through desktop"
2220,Great
2221,Thank you coursera for all the tutorials and user friendly interface.
2222,"Using Android 11 on Note 10+, the audio sporadically freezes when the app is put into background by going to the lock screen. Basically this means that you can't listen to audio of a lecture while going for a walk without the audio jamming up after a few seconds or a few minutes. It's infuriating. Fix it Coursera."
2223,Such a great experience...
2224,The quizes that pop up in the middle of the videos are not synchronized with the moment in which the video makes the pause. The pop up quizes are always shown 5 seconds after the pause in the video. Also at least twice after finishing the pop up tests you are logged out of your coursera account and you have to log in again to resume your learning.
2225,It was the first learning app I ever used and I was impressed by it's simple UI which makes it easy to navigate courses and track progress.
2226,Excellent work.
2227,We need search option on this app and an option se view certificate which we have completed thankyou
2228,This app requires development. It's not user friendly at all.
2229,"I have been using the app for a month, and it's been great so far except for an issue I discovered recently, I was automatically logged out and I tried signing in, but there's no interaction after putting my account details. This is really disappointing as I have downloaded 2 weeks worth of lectures and I can't have access to them. Please try and rectify this."
2230,"Pretty good, though I've needed to logout and login again for reasons I can't figure out. Android widget seems to have stopped working."
2231,Nice app
2232,"Experience is intermediate. Screen sometimes stops rotation. But the most loved item is that you can get ""Financial Aid"" which is very helpful for the students. Unlike other educational platforms, it is Ad-Free for all users. Thanks you Coursera ."
2233,Best app for gaining knowledge
2234,"Provides Wide variety of courses. But app doesn't function properly, it started hanging all the time."
2235,Please make payments from debit card too because people want courses like this but most of the students don't have credit cards. Please accept the payments from Debit card also.
2236,Very helpful
2237,Great platform to learn... 2 stars less for the laggy application on android in some cases...
2238,I love Coursera! It's so easy and helpful! :)
2239,Awesome
2240,The new logo is so much ugly. üòû
2241,It's a wonderful app for learning from the very best and learning formally. To keep my learning continued I do have the Coursera plus subscription active. My only real complain from the app is that the videos do not resume from where you left them off. This should be an obvious requirement and easily achiveable technically. Some sort of note taking abilities within the app should also be a good feature to add to the app.
2242,Latest update completely broke the video player in the app basically rendering the app unusable
2243,It is amazing to upgrade professional and personal career
2244,Thanks for free courses
2245,It is awesome üòäüòäüòä
2246,Excellent üëå
2247,Love the convince of the app however frequently the video quiz answers will say they are incorrect and when showing me the correct answer it is in fact the one I selected. It's quite frustrating and I can't find any information about this problem online. Aside from retaking them on my computer I can't fix my quiz marks.
2248,The app is good. It would have been much better if it had dark/night mode.
2249,The video buffering is a lot even in good speed. The course topics should be visible somehow from the video view as well. It is impossible to do the exercises in mobile if even 2 lines of code needs to be written. Ui needs fixing for the right amount of space.
2250,This recent update is lagging and making my learning experience terrible. Please fix it!
2251,App crashes on update
2252,great learning app because of audit course option i love this app üòäüòä
2253,Good
2254,Really educational with the free online courses
2255,Awesome application
2256,Recommended
2257,"I'm having a great time learning and the videos are always annotated with updated information. However, I'm having issues taking the quizzes. I retake them and the answers I selected are NOT what I initially marked after they are graded. Tested a few times and happens each time."
2258,Thank you Coursera for giving free access to various courses. I could learn lots of new skills during these lockdowns.
2259,"Totally disappointed !! I need to pay for this course but it shows error , I live in India , i tried with 4 different cards , tried paypal but no use ...my 7 days notes and time totally wasted ..you happy now ??"
2260,This app is totally good
2261,Very good app for students
2262,How can I access videos on this app? Love coursera but the app isn't great
2263,Best
2264,"Rather than other platforms, Coursera have very good quality designed courses. And Learning experience is also great. Coursera have very good support team, they are always ready to help us in any situation and any scenario."
2265,It's get stuck while playing videos
2266,"I prefer website than app, because the app is just not good. It doesn't have perks of website or I just feel app is not reliable as website."
2267,I must say it's really a great but It helped me a lot in my English and Korean of course at first I will I use this for Korean but later this app give me e Recommendation of other learning other languages other degrees except really like it and the teacher is so my associate professor teacher's awesome I also recommend to all the people who want to learn Korean English or any other language or degree subject I am really thankful to this app. I improved a loootttt.
2268,I love Coursera! ü•∞
2269,Great School
2270,will recommend for everyone who wants to learn
2271,Good
2272,"Everytime I use this app/site, I gets stuck in login login, tried to login with Google & from Email but can't login. Ultimately I've to use my friend's account to learn the course."
2273,"Great app, Coursera is the best!!!!!!"
2274,"I updated the app yesterday and it is not working properly, it is lagging big time and at times does not respond, please fix it, Thank you"
2275,This app is just excellent for learning & obtaining certificate.. But some of the surveys can only be done through computer.. Please fix this issue and try to make it more flexible so that we can do the task using mobile phone itself.. Please..
2276,Excellent
2277,OUTDATED Course!
2278,"Really... This app was really giving useful information with knowledge, skills n tests us with different subjects n topics n providing brilliant information. Thank you Courseraüòä"
2279,"Really incredible, i recommend this app to everyone who wants to learn or do online courses."
2280,Annoying experience on tablet. Constant orientation changes. Please make a landscape tablet version.
2281,"Thanks coursera, for free courses during Covid-19"
2282,Doesn't display like a browsers
2283,Answer options in quizzes can't be properly seen when using the app. A big disappointment as it's my only way to complete courses on Coursera right now.
2284,Very very good
2285,Awesome
2286,Very nice
2287,Please add a feature where you are able to increase/decrease the font of the notes. Otherwise the interface isn't bad and the progress bar/status is great.
2288,"The Mobile App of Coursera is TERRIBLE, especially since I am not able to view even a SINGLE course that I am currently doing (in the ""Coursera for Enterprise"" account). I will use the Webpage any day."
2289,Very nice app for certification and skill learning it is easy to use have great video and quiz help you gain skill and doesn't waste time everything is accessable and can be use anytime required . The best feature of this app is that we can share our certificate directly with our linkedin profile which is very good for people who have no job experience but have skills I prefer this to everyone because there's no age for learning
2290,Bad app
2291,Good app
2292,Great üòç application thanks
2293,"Don't Know Why But The App Works Fine For my Phone But It crashes On Tablet. Dear Coursera, Please fix this.."
2294,Good ‚ò∫Ô∏è application
2295,It's a great E-Platform which provides good sources of learning.
2296,I don't understand what's going on with the login via Facebook. I have to use coursera via browser before i can login. The app just won't login via Facebook.
2297,High price.
2298,App is amazing but quizzes are locked ... How can I get access to complete my course ...
2299,Don't load üò´ fast and it keeps buffering
2300,The app is not working . Its showing nothins please fix ASAP. Thankyou.
2301,"Good app. One suggestion, there are some surveys and tests that can only be attended using a computer kindly update to a form that it can also be performed in phone. Thank you. Hope you guys consider it."
2302,Very nice application for education üëç
2303,"Lol ü§£ app. Certificates have no value at all, they are toys."
2304,The app is good and easy to use but sometimes due to low internet connectivity it slows down which is normal with every application . So 5 out 5 stars .
2305,"First time of doing ceritificate course on-line , the app is wonderfully wonderful."
2306,The quiz s not loading properly only some words are visible thus not able to complete assignments
2307,Awesome!
2308,one of the Best app
2309,This app is definitely not what it promotes it to be ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2310,Nice app
2311,The app isn't optimised for tablet use AT ALL. Can you please at least make sure it can work 100% of the time in landscape mode?
2312,"The app is easy to use but after the last updating, there is a problem in showing the multible answer , the answer is not showing fully, just a few words available so I can't choose the right one."
2313,Best
2314,A platform that aids and boost your learning
2315,Technical issue: Some text in some courses is out of the page. Some questions in quizes are only showing one line and the rest of the question is hidden! Please solve ASAP.
2316,Subtitles should be customized more in size and location on the screen
2317,No customer support. They charge out money on inactive courses. Total fraud.
2318,It's good.... But in the quizzes the option were not clearly visible. Only some few words are visible. We can't able to find the correct answer.
2319,Very gd experience. Learned many courses through this. Found it very helpful. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2320,Good app to make your career grow
2321,"Please recheck the style on quiz options, multiline options truncated."
2322,Very informative courses
2323,Great app but no much option to choose from the courses
2324,Great
2325,this is program important for you.
2326,"Since the update, the app seems to be lagging a lot. The scrolling and interfacing is not that fluid. I am using a Samsung Galaxy M31s (6GB RAM, 128 GB internal storage)."
2327,"Add a dark theme, please"
2328,Pros - good courses from good universities/institutes/corporations. I think Coursera is economical compared to other upcoming learning platforms. Allows checking course through 'audit' option before opting for certificate. Certificate can be shown online. Cons - The app keeps signing me out every week.
2329,after update i can only see one line in the quiz options. i can read any option in app anymore. please update it..
2330,Some features dont work on the app
2331,Is it just me or does this app not work in huawei devices?
2332,"Respected sir/madam, Please add a feature of log in into various different devices so that we stay flexible with the content of our account using it in various devices."
2333,"One of the best apps for online courses. Video is a little unstable at times but overall, it's a success."
2334,"I have been using some other apps as well. But, the user interface and attention to detail of this app is the best for distant learnings. Thanks alot for the support God bless you all. Regards"
2335,Best
2336,Superb
2337,It's very good application but unfortunately did not support screen readers for the blind very well it's making me suffer as blind or visually impaired
2338,My app is lagging even the downloaded videos on app... Happening since I updated
2339,"I'm learning Japanese for begginers Course, I'm in 5th week. There's some problem with the tests. Whatever answer I select it shows it wrong. Please fix this problem as soon as possible."
2340,Extemely unfair refund policy. Quality of courses is often leas than perfect.
2341,Wonderful
2342,"The best thing about this app is, it just shattered the brick and mortar concept of quality education. Thank you everyone associated with Coursera."
2343,Need Save Notes (Note taking) Option in the Mobile App.
2344,"This app has to improve a lot. Very unsatisfied. Course material doesn't appear even on fastest internet. If weekly goals are set, only that appears in place of lessons and assignments. NO VIDEO APPEARS IF WEEKLY GOALS ARE SET. Slow, sluggish app, unintuitive interface. I love Coursera, but this app is unusable."
2345,App is damn good but when comes to download the video is still loading but doesn't get download....
2346,Debit crad not working do something
2347,Unreal
2348,Amazing teaching and learning app. Easy to use interface. Love learnings on this appüëçüèæ
2349,"This is a diamond app, it has helped me to learn many courses and I like it so much. But my major problem now is all the courses that I have completed, all have lost . So please I beg in the name of God and the management to let me get back those courses so that I can download them and make revision, otherwise I have learned nothing."
2350,Very educative
2351,It's really really very great appüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú
2352,Thank you so much
2353,I thought this app was dead cause i can't load anything on this app for the last 2 weeks now. It just keep asking me to refresh the page.
2354,"Addendum to my recent review: I'd like to see the same main user features in the app that are available on the website---highlighting, note taking, open responses, etc. The app is good, but overly simplistic, and lacking."
2355,Experience is very good
2356,I would have liked to complete. Does not look bad visually it jyst looks w/simple it is not. Just basic and kinda grafficless
2357,I've tried to download 3 times. All three times failed. Fix this.
2358,The most useful app
2359,"Absolutely, I love it üíõ"
2360,Please add a bookmark option. Bookmarking a course that i cant do yet but will do in future is best. Please provide that. It won't be that difficult i guess.
2361,nice app
2362,"Video gets stuck always, there seems to be some problem with video player of the app"
2363,Wonderful
2364,Great learning platform!
2365,Great
2366,Updated platform for to learn things online
2367,Not a single drawing class
2368,"The latest update won't allow logging in. It keeps asking to check internet connection, I wouldn't be able to post this review if I had no internet"
2369,Great
2370,Subscription not fair. You will charge without confirmation
2371,Add dark mode
2372,please add the save note button for android devices as well
2373,Stupid app. It loads slow waste of tims
2374,I can not get my certificate even i have completed all weeks still its showing 0 minute left in week one
2375,Nice
2376,"The course content is good but be careful not to pay or leave any payment details. Regardless of advertised rates or promotions, their system will try to collect the maximum rate, or continue billing after cancellation. You'll need to resolve with your bank since customer support is unable to do anything helpful."
2377,Sry but only paid available
2378,I like this app! Some courses are free within a certificate which is sweet!
2379,Costs of courses are too high not for students who belongs from average family
2380,Got my first certificate
2381,"While all the courses are well made, the app experience is poor on tablets, with no landscape mode for users. This is a basic feature that needs to be implemented"
2382,Excellent app ever made in the universe!
2383,"New update has many bugs. It's not correctly loading. It's showing I have to reset my deadlines after I reset my deadlines. Please fix it, otherwise it has been an amazing experience"
2384,Brilliant app brilliant courses.
2385,Good platform for learning new things
2386,Nice app
2387,Perfect....
2388,"Love the app, easy to use and good on any device. But I wish it had a bit more diversity in courses, feels like courses are limited."
2389,I would highly recommend this app because it's really useful for every each student in whichever stream. It's makes you feel confident to study hard and put you to study more to gain your knowledge.
2390,Excellent app for all students who want to learn many things which we cannot learn in our clg or university. The only which I want is please ensure you give all the resources of a course accessible in Mobile itself for some it requires desktop which has become a lot of trouble for many of the students of Coursera. Please take it seriously and Modify the app to suit all the things of course working on mobile also. Thankyou.
2391,The app is getting struck and comes out of the video frequently. Please look into it
2392,Best platform to everyone to develope their skills. Loved it üòç
2393,"kept saying ""sth went wrong when playing the video"" n thus video can't even be played on the app the pdf provided also cannot be opened but content was gd tho(access via website)! pls fix the app issue thnks! problems have been occurring over 2 months now....."
2394,The videos do not play smoothly...they break every single second..
2395,Fmdh Posting
2396,I haven't been able to sign into the app after the latest update. Not sure why. This was done over multiple days with the same result- no reaction from the app. It was perfect for use earlier but it seems to be having issues now.
2397,The login button is not responding after entered email and password
2398,It is waste and very bad
2399,Extraordinary
2400,"I found this app, the best of all the apps I have used for taking an online course. GOOD JOB üëç"
2401,What is wrong with video player?? Why does is it starts feeling as if my mobile can't play the video properly? Still haven't fixed the problem...
2402,"Please find an option for the new Huawei(P40 lite), as this app only works with Google Play."

2420,keeps logging me out extremely irritating
2421,I love coursera. Would be nice if the app could rotate in both landscape directions when playing video.

2423,"Pls fix inapp darkmode theme , sometimes black color text hide behind the dark background making it unreadable."
2424,Great
2425,How do I stream the lecture video on my smart TV? It has streaming icon on the top right corner of the video but I can't tap on it. Please help.

But the four stars are coming for the performance of the mobile app. It just doesn't work normally at all and sometimes it's very annoying and time consuming. The app freezes constantly and also responds too slowly. Please, work on the app performance"
2503,"Great platform to learn and grow, overall the best platform one can get but the app takes a bit more time than usual to open and operate, leading to bad experiences sometimes.

2527,Why We cannot access the website and even on this app? please fix this problem thank you
2528,"""we had trouble loading your data"" all the time. Very slow. No filter (only on the website but that is unbeliveable slow). Also no option to save ""interesting"" courses. It is just not good. Can you take courses to make this app better?"
2529,So awesome! Thank you Coursera!
2530,It is not accepting debit card
2531,This is the worst learning app I ever seen. They mainly focused on hogging money only. Courses are loading very very slowly and in quizz section only white page is show. Please try to fix the bugs
2532,So good. I love this app. This app helped me to learn more
2533,Reality of coursera.. they have advertised Google technical support certification on LinkedIn for free.. Asked me to a link card for rs5 subscription charges and today without confirmation debited 1099rs from account.completely fraud and also there is no option to contact support or chat.. just static pages in the website.. biggest scan with students.. really very very sad üò• cheating with students. MAY GOD CLOSE YOUR FRAUD BUSINESE. SOMEONES BLOOD AND SWEET MONEY HAS BEEN STOLEN.
2534,It has many bugs
2535,Love it! This is my 2nd week using Coursera: First Step Korean. The course is provided by Yonsei University and the professor is great. She's a true professional at what she does. The lessons are very clear and concise. They also provide PDF forms to practice w/ea lesson. That's been very helpful as I practice Hangul. They have forums for students to ask questions and help each other out. I would definitely retake it in order to solidify what I'm learning now. Absolutely recommend this app.
2536,We need night mode and the option to favorite enrolled courses

2554,Very useful
2555,Everytime When I used to watch the downloaded course video starts to get lag after 10 minutes of watching. Also heat the Phone at the same time.
2556,Courses over here are Overrated! It's better to stick with YouTube!

2558,Slow to start.
2559,The payment systemof this site is so bad. I used 3 different master card but it declined

2592,"Love The AUDIT COURSE option & That's The BEST USP for this App. ThankYou So MUCH for Providing an Option to Freely LEARN. Also, The QUALITY of APP (UI Design) & Content QUALITY is MUCH MORE Appreciated & It's The BEST Learning App . (Better than UDAMY or SkillShire) I think that YOU MUST add the 144p or 240p Option as MOST People WANT to Use Limited Data (Especially INDIANS like ME). So, We Spend MOST of Time on YouTube. I'M saying That Do It ONLY If Possible.Thanks AGAIN for the Audit OPTION."
2593,Nice
2594,The best all time.
2595,Good cousres are avaible here and the best thing is that we can audit them

2602,"Can you guys please introduce dark mode. And also, I'd like some better way of organizing my courses. Right now it seems like an infinite drag. Also, can the course progress for audit courses not include the assignments because it's annoying that my course progress is hindered at week 1 only because I don't do the paid assignments which are for the paid users. It would be nice if there was a separate progress for content and assignments so people auditing courses can check their progress."
2603,Annoying popups showing again and again. Could not even scroll the page on mobile. Kindly fix this
2604,Using both the web and the android app so far I like both. The app is very useful and it is well designed imho. Thanks devs!

2606,"There are many such apps. can't say whether have overall satisfaction with the courses n ui there, both free ones and paid ones. But I can say how satisfied I am with the app. The structure of the courses n UI.Quality Courses in public interest is really very good.

First of all it said on the official website that I can't unroll from a course I had applied for in the previous version of the website and app. And second, bcos of college exams I couldn't finish the module of one week. And so I want to reset my deadlines. But it stops responding and many times right after taking a quiz, the app shows an error and resets the quiz. This is seriously annoying and time consuming. Do fix it."

2630,"Dear developer, I used to spent more time a day on coursera rather than any other application on my mobile device. I really enjoyed using this for a long time, After using this for many years now I realise it is missing one simple but essential functionality. Coursera doesn't support an auto rotate feature. Could you kindly bring this change on the coming update."
2631,"i would give a five star. for sake of learning, please fix the video player! it's super buggy, makes the phone hot; after some time watching download video(not a internet speed issue), the player start to zzzzz, like riding in bumpy road :( or just implement vlc open source player. edit: v3.13.0, u guys did not fix the video player."

2643,What makes me happy is that people like me who can't afford high and premium prices of courses can learn variety of free courses here.
2644,Enormous app
2645,"Greatest online educational app, ever !"
2646,I am not able to renroll after unenrolling in a course in the mobile application. I would love a 5 star but such things makes the experience worse.
2647,Overall good app. But you need to provide a way to view the video getting downloaded. There should be option to cancel download.
2648,Using my cell phone but coursera doesn't think I'm connected to the internet....... But I am!
2649,Just perfect!
2650,App is good. one feature of adding notes during video lectures that is available on website should be added here.

2654,Good
2655,I can't reach my notes on the app. Anyone having the same issue?
2656,I love this application
2657,"Worst app I've ever seen. It keeps crashing and whenever I play any lecture, it plays fine for few minutes, but after that it keep on stopping again and again. Whenever I try to download the lecture, it crashes. Have updated the app multiple times, but the bugs are not fixing. It get even worse with every update."
2658,Please add a save note feature to the app.
2659,Great learning app
2660,Beautiful app
2661,"Whenever we go to an activity from my courses list and come back, it loads all the courses from the beginning instead of saving the app state. It makes the app really slow and time consuming for users to navigate through different sections."
2662,IT is just amazing!!! The quality of their contents and presentation gives a learner that confidence not to drop a course from start to finish. But they need to improve on their help desk support.
2663,Awesome
2664,"Had a very great experience while using the app, everything is user friendly, there are a lot of courses which will help you improve your skills, the best part is that you don't learn the courses From local people, different professors from universities teach you."
2665,You have a block on viewing content on the mobile phone. Why did you create this app? To literally gaslight your members. Then try to locate customer support. Contact email is buried deep in a forest of useless FAQS. I had to email the privacy team to reach a human. I do not expect to remain with this service unless some things change pretty quickly.
2666,Best app. Very responsive if you need any help. Wide range of courses offered
2667,It is a very good app
2668,Privacy statement for IT course comes up upon signing in and jams the app. Even tried reinstalling.

2671,They don't always give the certificates.
2672,worst app I have ever seen don't waste your money by doing in this and the supporting teams also not helping to get our problems solved and after submitting also it is not showing the grade by this thing I didn't get my certificate they only say us to wait but it will never happen!!!
2673,Best app!
2674,this is the worst app i have ever seen when i was working in peer grading my work has jot been graded and i was asked to wait for sometime to be updated but there no result then they told that my work is wrong and it cannot be graded but for others who did the same work was been graded.Because of one peergrading exercise i was not given the certificate waste of money and time worst app.and the supporting team responses are really worst which are like computer based responses they say the same
2675,This is the worst app i never seen When im all done with my project and submitted later onwards they are telling that your project is not correct...one of my friends are done with that same project they got correct and they will given certificate...then what about my project?? what's the mistake??while i contact the supporting team they simply saying our computer is not accepting your project and system is locked we can't do anything...
2676,"1 star for the app developer, can't log in. It shows ""account linked to social account"" error while trying to log in with Google."

2685,I am not able to creat new account in the app
2686,Thank you for providing free courses! I have not spent even a single penny for this. Coursera is creating professions all around the world!!
2687,This app is great ...I have learnt a lot...some of the test needs to be done on a computer
2688,"Coursera has amazing wide courses from beginners to advanced level learning, it also has inbuilt projects which help student understand better amd work on it. I highly recommend coursera for anyone who are really interested in learning."
2689,GOOD
2690,The app won't let me submit the peer reviews. It's frustrating.
2691,This app is fantastic üëåüëå but downloading vedios are worst so coursea has to work on this

2703,This app is great. My comment is just add the accomplishment interface and a down button that prompts learners to download the video.
2704,Slowest sloth. The latest update almost froze coursera app. I can't play course videos even downloaded ones. Please take action. It's horrible!
2705,Please fix overheating issue. Battery consumption is a lot
2706,Worst app. I have completed one course successfully but I didn't received any certificate related to that course. No response from them. It's disgusting
2707,Nice app for students üëçüëåüëåüëåüëçüëç
2708,Top tier MOOC application
2709,Works great! Thank you.
2710,Great app üëçüëç But can you please add an option to turn off the subtitles in the videos? üòå
2711,My brain is about to be a prof Uses data sadly
2712,Overwhelming.
2713,Well the point is why have an app when a lot of courses when you click on them just opens the browser on my phone... SERIOUSLY SO THE RESULT OF A WORLDWIDE collection of universities cannot make a good app out of their app! Yea I do claim I am smarter than all their logic combined since that logic is just beyond stupid.
2714,Beneficial app
2715,"A huge amount of courses is available on coursera, It helped me Achieving my essential skills. Thank you very much coursera for your Campus Initiative ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2747,Loved the app. Good functionality
2748,The cast option doesn't work
2749,I did an easy course on coursera. I was promised $150 if I finished it. So far I have not heard anything about them giving it to me. I was billed again even after finishing the coarse even though I'm struggling financially because of the pandemic. I never asked to do another course but I was billed anyway. Everytime I go to the help center they say they are experiencing high volume of chats so they can't help me. So I can't get refunded. And they won't give me the $150 they said they would
2750,great going!!
2751,Please develop a dark UI mode for eye care!
2752,Perfect
2753,"The application is outstanding. I just have one problem, there is no way off changing preferences on the recommended section"

2779,Courses are perfect to learn.. But they need to work on NOTEBOOK for ML related assignments
2780,the app is running smoothly besides I found all I want but it need to be working on the quiz to be working smoothly on the app.
2781,"Best one for online courses,"
2782,Terrible. What a shame.
2783,"My experience with the app is poor. It keeps existing whenever I am studying a course, the courses don't have English transcripts offline. It takes long time for the app to load course contents. The videos skip also when paused for a long time."
2784,"Overall helpful and mostly reliable. Plenty of interesting things to learn and some good instructors. Issue with losing my place. If I minimize the app even just for a moment, when I go back to it the lesson starts over from the beginning."
2785,This is a course app
2786,"I urge you guys to reconsider payment options, for subscriptions atleast for Indian users, credit cards are the only mode of payment, every other transaction fails. Please give us an alternative mode of payment, as in lump sum which can be paid via debit card. It is very difficult for students and low income salaried employees to get access to credit cards here. I know many friends and colleagues who are unable to access your courses due to lack of credit cards. Please think about it."
2787,"This app truly was a turning point in my life. Though others opinion is that the certificate is not worth to get into a job, I won't agree bcoz without something which doesn't give you a good understanding cannot make you a skilled or knowledgeable, rather the courses I've learnt through this are quality ones if you truly enjoy learning. Cheers Coursera team :)"

2793,Useful
2794,Great educational platform..
2795,I have just installed this application on cell phone. There are Google and Facebook options available to log in. I have tried many times to log in to this application with my Google account. But it doesn't log in. What's reason behind not to be log in with Google account?

2806,No dark mode on coursera for android ?
2807,You can actually learn useful skills

2811,No words to say as such since it is been person who saved us when in the middle of water. I learnt more from this app and even they support the learners with profound care.
2812,Curses are very heigh quality but very expencive not for poor students or person.
2813,Nice app to learn everything
2814,I'm not being able to login. Why?
2815,Really helpful
2816,"On offline mode, after watching a video for more than 4 minutes on average, it starts lagging. The lag rate increases from 1 to 2 to 4 to 6 seconds with time, so I have to kill the app and start again. This is very irritating and breaks the chain. Fix it ASAP!"
2817,Nice
2818,i can use this app on my phone but not my laptop? why?
2819,It's too much slower
2820,Best app.
2821,I can't able to login through app...it show a third party account is already linked...what does it means üòí
2822,dark mode needed
2823,Videos have problem downloading sometimes. App shows download started but it doesn't download anything.
2824,I love this app it connects with a lot of renowned University and gives a lot of knowledge and skills.
2825,I can't login with my email and password because this app demands google play services and don't let me in. Are you serious? You don't need google play services to let me study!
2826,I love learning from Coursera
2827,I'm recommended this app very useful
2828,"It's been two days my Coursera app has been crashed in the middle of a video, then i updated the app but the problem getting worst ....Please help me if you can... I'm using this almost 6 months but the problem is there now it start annoying meüòûüòû"
2829,"Loved it man, just loved it. It's really very easy to use. Coursera collaborates with top universities in the world to bring us world class knowledge to build up the skills and technical knowledge we want. And that too at very less cost. Take your time to complete the courses and you are good to go. Coursera is the best!!!!!üòä"
2830,Lack of Dark Mode. Please can we have dark mode?
2831,1. Tried to subscribe to a specialization course & couldn't do so coz they CHANGED their payment rules within a matter of months! PURE BS! Just coz I'm in India I can't pay or access any course now? Not everyone has credit cards of rarely heard banks!! 2. The app is such a waste compared to the browser version. Wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE. 3. Courses are good but HIGHLY EXPENSIVE. Not that it matters as I'm unable to pay even though I'm willing to!! I'm very very DISAPPOINTED!
2832,It will be helpful if the app also allows note taking.
2833,Best app for learning anything
2834,"I love coursera itself but the app sucks. If you lost internet connection during quizzes, it does not save your answers, basically erasing your whole progress. If you accidentally rotate your screen during a peer-graded assignment, it automatically deletes your answers if you did not save it."
2835,12 years
2836,The BEST educational app in the world. PERIOD. Everyone should be appreciative of all the professor's from all over the world who make videos of their basic AND advanced college classes.. for FREE!!! I have been using this app for 8 YEARS!! I have learned SO much and felt like I was sitting in a classroom. I love this app and love that I always have the power to learn rich and powerful education right on my phone.
2837,"It's really good to have classes in our mobile anytime anywhere but here what some of the issues i have faced , it's start buffering which is a kind of irritating even though I've downloaded that video it's buffering while playing pl check through this , thank you"
2838,"Poor choice and $49 a month.. 49 USD is 1.1 million vnd. Not cheap, or rather, not worth it"
2839,Loot money in name of course and not provide certificate for completed course. Waste of time and money .
2840,great learning experience
2841,Best way to learn. Should add more features.
2842,Very excellent and interesting app. This platform is fit for lifetime learners like me.
2843,Please activate Quiz of the courses so that i can complete the course and obtain my certificate. I talked to proffesors and they told us that the quizes are locked by Coursera not by the instructors. So please activate the quiz as soon as possible.
2844,"Great and exceptional app!! The instructors and videos are easy to understand. Coursera is full of knowledge and am glad to be a partaker, courtesy ingressive for good network."
2845,Great
2846,I discovered this app thru tesda online. This is a great app to help people enhance their knowledge.
2847,Terrible experience with the app. The videos do not download...they download at far lower speeds. Also while directly streaming the videos have breaks/lags all the time. I mean they are teaching so many courses but they can't make a proper app. What even!
2848,Very Disappointing charged Me of 3600Rs without my permission nd not giving my Refund
2849,"Very disappointing Charged Me 3600 Rs Without My Permission ,Totally Disgusting ...Don't Registered on it nd Dont put ur Card details.Not Giving Me My Refund...plz help what should i do????"
2850,Great thing is that we work .
2851,Excellent App for Learning. The UI is not as great as the website one but that shouldn't stop you from learning.
2852,To much bugs. The main feature it needs to be added is to view assignment doc/pdf/pptx file using the app not the browser üòí.
2853,"Hard to believe how bad they can make this app. None of the usual Android manoeuvres are possible. Cannot zoom in, select text, copy, share into dictionary, I'm trying to learn Chinese but I give up. Uninstalled"
2854,"Really good, but video watched sometimes does not mark as completed on the web version of the app."
2855,Really insightful üëè thorough training.
2856,üíïüíï
2857,Best Learning App
2858,"Some classes have poor quality, yet Coursera won't allow you to refund the class even minutes after purchasing it. Support was very unhelpful."
2859,Fantastic app for education
2860,The app keeps crashing.
2861,Nice app
2862,Best platform for learning online
2863,"Terrible experience with this app. This app is poorly optimised. After I watch an offline video and move on to next video I'm experiencing heavy lag in the video. In order to fix this I have to close the app and open this again. After watching the 2nd video and moving on to 3rd video the same lag occurs. I have to repeat this process till my course is completed. Also, I'm experiencing EXTREME BATTERY DRAIN while using this app. Even PUBG Mobile does not drain this much battery in my device."
2864,Loved it! Got the the spur I needed.
2865,Problem in reseting course deadlines.
2866,Good
2867,Good

2871,Good
2872,Giving no response
2873,It was awesome experience of learning in this program
2874,No option to choose video quality
2875,The main problem I have with some apps they won't display on the screen so I have to open apps on Google play
2876,Zkass
2877,Wow
2878,Very useful for personal development
2879,In my M10 tab the video doesn't fit. Video goes out of screen. Now uninstalled this useless app and using browser instead. The feedback seems useless
2880,"Serves its purpose. Downloading, quiz taking available in offline mode. It is great app. But it is very slow. Loads UI slowly. I love the website, though. Needs work in making it fast."
2881,Too much expensive course.it should be like range in Udemy.udemy cheap and great
2882,I can't even log in......how disappointing.....opening a new account....terrible
2883,"Very Good app, contains several courses of interest and relevance, but the only problem is that it doesn't have alot of courses on certain subjects, international law for instance. On the whole its a great app, but 5 stars if you add more courses on the same!"
2884,Its the best but sometimes when I try to rejoin the site with an already created account it reply an error fix only that other things are great...!!!
2885,Best app
2886,Great learning experience
2887,"I'd subscribed for IBM AI Engineer Specialization course that contains 6 courses. It first showed 7 day free trial and INR 3589 per month afterwards. I subscribed to it with payment card details entered, completed first course and started with its first assignment on IBM cloud, I didn't receive any notifications, but after 7 day free trial nothing deducted from my card and I my subscription was inactivated without notice. I re-subscribed, now 1course+1 certificate will be charged 3589/month??"
2888,I did almost 4-5 courses on Coursera and totally enjoyed the learning process.
2889,Excellent
2890,This app is not for free we have pay
2891,Good app
2892,Uses up atleast 500mb of RAM still it lags for offline videos....uses up so much battery that even games are better than this app for battery optimization.Resolve these problems.
2893,So good
2894,Good
2895,The app gets struck whole playing a downloaded course video.. faulty bug application
2896,It loads a lot of time before showing courses enrolled

2898,Trying to login with my old Manipal University email id registered here which I never used and can't even enter to see courses as partnership with uni is not there now .It is also my Facebook id ? Now I have to make a new email to just see courses ?
2899,I liked everything about the app untill i could no longer continue on my mobile phone. After hours of trying to log into my acc on the comp i tried reaching out only to find out they only have email support its 2020 aint nobody got time for that we need help now and fast!
2900,Terrible and ungodly expensive

2916,Best app
2917,Amazing app
2918,Very good app
2919,The main things the Coursera have is quiz and assignment submission which remind us everytime that we have to submit assignment within time. So in this way we have to understand all the things and complete the assignment and quiz. The best to learn something.
2920,Each and everything is paid. People better study at home with books.
2921,It's a great app for finding topics to learn and manage your interests. However one thing it would benefit from is something such as a wishlist where you could store courses you are interested in for later
2922,I am interesting this and it's useful Application
2923,This app is not working. When i open the app after downloading it is not loading the UI. I have checked my internet connection. I saw my connection is very good. Also download the app twice after uninstalling. I can't use it further. Please update the features of this app.

2928,Can we have Continue button on Courses. Its TDS to find the Video from where I need to do continue especially when there are many weeks in a Course.
2929,Very good. I have learned a lot.
2930,"The downloaded courses (audit) keep hanging , I means the videos . Pls do something about it. That's has been happening since you changed the colour option of ""GO TO COURSE"" from green to blue."
2931,"It's really a great App, easy to use and very accessible."
2932,Great but need to update the questions the questions asked are outdated.
2933,"Cannot login easily ,plz fix that error"
2934,"Unable to login, No reCaptcha overlay when the login button is pressed. Possible webview problem. Device: Poco F1, Android 10"
2935,Awesome app/website to learn stuff.
2936,"Awesome app, you will feel so comfortable and confident after completing specialization of courses. Thanks to Coursera teams"
2937,"I think its good, but last time I wasn't able to pass a quizz because the answer was a matrix. I can't write a matrix with this app"
2938,Awesome... Everything is great... Haven't encountered any issues yet.. Great for learning online..
2939,"For me,one of the greatest features of coursera is the forums. The mentors are really active and they reply within a day. Also, the instructors are highly educated and they are the best in their field,whatever might be the course. Truly this is the best app in my phone"
2940,Unable to login with Facebook A dialog appears with Facebook login error Please check you internet connection. But I'm able to login in my other account through logging in with google
2941,It's a really very helpful app for learning
2942,"The pages on the app aren't formatting correctly. The audios are way at the bottom, the text sometimes are in logical order, and sometimes all mixed up. Also, the course material on the app is sometimes different from the website on a pc or even on mobile chrome/ browsers. It's like a different course, or a first draft that never got updated and synced to the final copy. Please fix this! :("
2943,I have not been able to download my courses and it's drawing me back. Please see to this üôè
2944,I would suggest to add dark mode.

2948,Best learning app for student
2949,"The app is too buggy. After scrolling down it keeps sending you back to the beginning of the page. Also, it's not compatible with dark mode on Xiaomi."

2952,Gd app
2953,"Recommend everyone this app. This made my studying easy. I can download lecture videos, notes through this app. And I can mark deadlines of quizzes and assignments."
2954,"Very slow, videos can't play properly, and courses are not at all optimized for mobile, so they are full of bugs that crash videos and prevent tasks from being completed. Excellent on a computer. Complete trash on a phone as no effort was made to adapt anything to mobile. Portrait and landscape flips crash the app. Searching for classes crashes the app. Looking sideways at your phone crashes the app."
2955,I encounter glitches while using the App[a lot to be precise].
2956,Can we access multiple accounts with this app?
2957,Python console does not work completely on my app . I am unable to complete any quizzes due to that. I have to use the a browser for that which also provides challenges... I also feel that no one from Coursera even cares to respond which is quite unfortunate
2958,"I'm sorry, love the app and the courses but why is it so difficult to download the videos? I already suffer from crappy network but I really can't download anything even when I have excellent network. So, I don't know, how does YouTube do it? Like, my data could be in a coma and YouTube still works. Soooo. Please and thank you for your hard work team."
2959,World Class at a fraction of the price.
2960,Coursera is a rip off. Think twice before throwing your money away. Their customer service is not helpful at all when you need help
2961,"great platform great content, my fav app ever"
2962,Great idea and content but poor app
2963,Really we appreciate the Founders and their Vision for Educating the Peoples around the world.

I decided to shift to my tablet and use the android app but I faced lots of bugs and problems, especially when it comes to common features like automatic rotation! I really cannot understand Why in some pages the app gets stuck in vertical mode and does not adopt the whole horizontal view."

3050,"I have been noticing this lag bug during the video courses as well as browsing within the app. While watching a video, it starts normal but in one-third of the video's duration, it starts dropping frames and lags which then is consistently magnified along the video. This turns out really uncomfortable and restarting the app is always needed, though later the app starts misbehaving again alike."
3051,This app has really been helpful to me in many ways. Also I have learnt a lot more through Coursera than in school and college. Really thankful for the team of Coursera and all the universities aligned with them üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè

3093,I have completed the course (Psychological First Aid) using a promotion but I still didn't get my certificate I would appreciate if you look into this matter and provide me a certificate ASAP. I got the required marks but I don't know why you people didn't showed a certificate at the end of the course.  I hope you look forward into this matter and meet my demands.. Thank you
3094,App doesn't load fast. It takes too much time though having good Internet connection. So many bugs! Using in browser is far better. Only helpful when you want to make videos offline and it also got many bugs. :(
3095,"Used to be able to use this app offline. I work at sea so a lot of the time I tend to have slow or no internet connection. Recent updates have meant I can't log in to use the app without an internet connection, and on a slow connection the reCaptcha session times out and I can't log in. This means I'm now paying for a course I can only do half the year when I'm at home. Please fix so it can be used offline again and on the move like at sea or on a plane."
3096,"I enjoy the online courses and programs provided by Coursera. I have attained a wide variety of subject matter knowledge ranging from business, technology, and healthcare."

3356,"Thank you, Coursera. The courses are so comprehensive. Love learning with you"
3357,The current courses I'm enrolled in really know how to keep me away from the app. Peer reviews are useless and often unfair. The readings and videos are fine but the assigments weren't designed for mobile devices. Currently I'm stuck a 98% on some courses (WITH CERTIFICATES!) because the assigments are impossible to complete.
3358,"It is a good app for learning and all but many times I find myself logged out and unable to log back in and only after a day or two am I able to log in again, even though I am perfectly able to login from browser"

It seems to register a click but nothing happens. I have to resort to using the web browser on my phone to use it. Please fix this issue!"
3370,How come the developers forgot to add the option of turning subtitles off while watching the videos?! It's really annoying and unjustifiable!
3371,It's awesome. I would just recommend a favorites icon so I can save a wishlist for courses I want to take in the future.

3472,"I used to use this fairly regularly when it was all free. I was disappointed to log back in after a while and find that most courses require payment now. I guess I understand it since these are very high quality classes, but for someone who is just learning for fun, I'm now much more inclined to just do some google searches instead. Good app if you have real set goals for learning though, and I am glad they've allowed continued free access to the courses I'd already enrolled in."

4357,Love the setup! Might as well learn while you're staring at the screen I say to my boy. Now I'm doing it lol .
4358,The best learning platform I have seen
4359,Lot of Ads
4360,I have used it on desktop version but couldn't even sign in on the app. i wonder what's wrong with it...
4361,"The app does not deserve more than 3 stars.The app is not so enriched.I could not find a lot of features in the app.It seems like coursera can only be used in computers properly, not in phones.So please make the app better."
4362,Really worst experience when submitting assignments. Still I could not submit assignment.. It is showing unknown error
4363,I think the infinite symbol of coursera signifies the infinite time it takes to load the app üòë
4364,"Very Helpful. Free courses from up-to-date international unicversities with Notes and quiz facilities. Only certificates require payment. Splended. I would've given it 5 ‚òÜ if the deadline for multiple courses didn't started at once. Even thought missing deadlines do not affect my course progress, it should've been more managable like the Udemy."
4365,Very bad experience
4366,Ok
4367,I can't access runestone interactive please make available of login from the phone
4368,The last update has messed up the interface. Shows error every time i try to open quizzes. Cannot skip to next video directly. Was working fine till last update
4369,"After last update, the app has become slow, takes time to respond and video lags.... Please fix"
4370,3h
4371,"New update is quite good but I have some problem with the certificate issuing. Some universities are not providing certificates even after the completion. It's been a month now Hopkins haven't provided the certificate for Covid-19 course, same with Toronto University for Mind Control. And please provide the locked courses on Mobile mode too. Last message of mine : I am highly disappointed. I am not able to complete my courses in time. It is getting irritating. I request to fix it."
4372,nice app
4373,The downloaded videos are not deleted from memory after deleting it in the app. It just stops showing it in the downloaded contents. Please fix this bug.
4374,Poor aap
4375,Very good to study during lock down. Flexible deadlines. Short videos with well explained overview of the video lectures.
4376,Even the updated version isn't working... Please fix it Using OnePlus 7t
4377,Wifi downloads are not working. Mobile data are the only means through which refresh and download. Can you update this problem
4378,"Very bad ux, awful login sign up methods"
4379,I can't click Log in button after typing password.
4380,Good
4381,"The mobile and web UI are bad. Video playback is buggy. The content is poor compared to other online courses and what is freely available elsewhere. The user experience is inconsistent across platforms. It's difficult to tell if you've enrolled in a free course, a trial, or a paid course and it's uncertain what you're going to be billed for. The FAQ pages seem years out of date."
4382,Good for learning but always have an issue with serve. Sometimes unable to upload assignment/ submit a quiz
4383,Perfect but would be more if it had a word counter for aid application
4384,Sometimes it will restart while playing also. Please repair it.

4389,Full of bugs
4390,It's a raelly good app overall.
4391,Bad
4392,"It has come to my attention that there are other learners on this website who think that it's OK to give other people bad grades and leave zero feedback to support it. I have personally been victim of this for my first assignment. When I see this happening, I will report you. Has any of this happened to any other learners here? Before you resubmit an assignment after such horrible feedback, I would personally recommend that you report the other learner for their violation of the Honor Code. "" You may not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve your results or dishonestly improve or damage the results of others."" Upon relaying this information off the the ""support"" team, I was basically told they aren't going to do ANYTHING about it. I ended my email with these two statements: ""I repeat, this is a violation of the Honor Code. If you don't make any reciprocation's for this learner's actions, I'm no longer going to continue using this site and I will make sure that other people don't fall victim to utilizing it either."" ""It is my duty to report these violations and it is your duty to make reciprocation's for these actions."" Don't spend any money through this website or app unless you know for sure that your courses aren't subject to this highly flawed grading system."

4394,Coursera is my favorite ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç app. Thanks üòä for the builders
4395,Homeworks are difficult to review on this app. Allow users to see others' review on our work. Forum is also very disorganized. I should be able to find my post easily. What's the point of the app if I can't see reviews and my own posts?
4396,Nice app for learning

4413,I updated this app yesterday and all my offline videos got deleted without any warning or anything. Coursera plz fix this
4414,Everything is better on the app. EXCEPT! The homework. For some reason the assignments will NOT pull up at all. I do not understand why.
4415,My assignment is not getting reviwed since many days! It's the worst experience. I need to submit the certificate and can't seem to make it work!!!! Fix it
4416,Nice courses but the app crashes sometimes.
4417,After the update the captions are not matching the video speed. The captions are faster than the video.
4418,In new version facing so many problems. Peepers review is not working.
4419,Good
4420,It's good!!
4421,"It was working fine, all of a sudden like two days ago, it started misbehaving saying I haven't done any course yet when I have already gotten 5 certificates"
4422,The latest version has some bugs. I can't login Now. Please fix next version
4423,"Perfect for on the go learning, updated content and great courses."
4424,Best educational apps ever...learning so much...might be better if more and different field subjects and topics are included...

4426,I'm not able to subscribe the course i want to takeüòêüôÑ
4427,"The worst app ever seen...such a great platform Coursera is but they have not built a good application for android phone. It crashes a lot. To see 4 min video I have to turn on and off coursera application 2 times. Worst app , please try to cover this problem"

4436,Unable to get login with this app
4437,It's so nice app
4438,We need dark mode support in Coursera app. Because in the current covid 19 senario we are learning through Coursera platform than before. White mode or background is painful during learning.
4439,Love it
4440,Learning new things is very easy and interesting using coursera
4441,It's the best platform for learning but somewhere I felt like there should be a extra faculty when the assignment is submitted to review that completely we have to depend on the other participants over there and assignment doesn't get reviewed for days and days and days and we have to wait just for single assignment which we already submitted and it has not been reviewed it is a very bad thing which I can tell that is lagging behind that is the reason I am giving a one star overall it's good
4442,Great platform for learning! Thanks coursera for your free subscription in the lockdown :) Only thing I am concerned is that the answers of many courses are easily available on github or youtube which deteroits itd value
4443,This App hangs everything whenever try to open it. . Why does this happen???
4444,This is the most and thee best Time Productivity app during these Pandemic time.. Knowledge is unstopable!
4445,Good
4446,Very helpful on my personal and professional growth.

4453,"The app is wonderful, i would like to learn how to create mobile apps and games, pls what courses do i have to take, thank you in anticipation of an answer"
4454,"Bad but don't know the whole thing is a fraud ;the whole point is, I subscribed to the 7 day free trial and entered my room card üí≥ information, after that I got deducted 3 times and later sent a mail subscription failed. And you have to refund me what you have deducted or to court and if in case I get deducted without informing me , my knowledge then all your works will run into the drain."

4486,Best courses
4487,Having problem after browsing or watching lecture for 1-1.5min. ...i had to restart the app every time after 1-1.5min .
4488,Powerful and enlightening content
4489,Easy to use!
4490,"When I used to sign in from browser, it gets signed it with an ease, using same email and same password, this app shows it invalid, I tried to change my password hundreds of time but it only shows your password is incorrect. I think this is a prank application."
4491,Learning from the platform is easy and curated.
4492,the app is very great and very usefull. But 1 thing was it has no Save Note option as in its website.
4493,"Coursera > Offers Paid Certification Only and Free Course's From Renowned and International Universities for online Education to enhance and enrich your skill sets. Ensure using your laptops, tablets or Desktop Computers as Courses can not be done over the phone be an Android phone or iOS no no, it just doesn't work well at all on mobile phones."
4494,I loved the idea behind this app and was really happy to get a hold of it but I dont know why it keeps on crashing. I have started a course but it started crashing after just 5 mins
4495,Nice
4496,Perfect for exploring new courses at low costs
4497,Please fix the app! I'm paying good $$$ for the quality content but every time I'm looking at videos on my phone I have issues where they suddenly stop playing and I can't resome.
4498,"wow,just wow"
4499,I can not log in to my account. please help me.
4500,Good initiative
4501,It was working pretty much good but from today network connectivity issue arose with this app please fix this issue as soon as possible
4502,"Nothing loads properly even in good internet connection, even answered has to be done multiple times to get the answer submitted, when downloading a course some videos don't get downloaded, all in all worst app to learn. Better go to udemy, better app and cheaper course."
4503,Sometimes it runs perfectly but now I'm facing a problem that... it's showing an internet connection error. I don't know why it's showing that because others apps are running perfectly with the same internet. I hope coursera will fix the bug soon.
4504,"Can't login to my account. Faces many issues and my all old data, course details and certificates history I losed."
4505,The app crashes down most of time!! It's frustrating.

4508,"After i did some updates, i suddenly lost my course & can't open my course. It says that i don't enrolled any courses yet. Help"
4509,"It has stopped suddenly and is showing connectivity issues when my connection is totally stable. I am already enrolled in courses but it's not showing, neither the courses nor my certificates!"
4510,"Udemy is so much better. This app crashes so much and uses ""Internet connection issue"" as an excuse to cover up its rubbish design"
4511,Can't upload my assignments properly. Nothing is working not even pdf or anything. Even suddenly my coursera account stopped working though my internet connection is proper still I am not able to go through it.
4512,"Many times the Courses activity shows that I have not enrolled in any course although searching and going to the course shows that I am enrolled. And, maths expressions do not load at all in the assignments."
4513,"Excellent, kindly update multiple device login options"
4514,"My mobile has sufficient amount of ram with good internet connectivity but then also sometimes when i open the app it lags frequently,please fix this issue."

4528,The app is constantly crashing when courses are put to download
4529,Excellent
4530,The app is draining the battery like hell and thus heating abnormally. Don't know if it is the case with all the mobiles but mine is OnePlus 6T
4531,Always it is telling network problems ...üò°üò°
4532,I started using this app and I found it very useful for those who are interested in online education. It provides certificate for the course which we complete. And this is such a wonderful platform for e - learning. One of the special thing I found about this app is it is accessible for Android phones too. So easy to use and gain a valuable certificate. During the life long time we wouldn't be able to attend direct classes and this app is helpful for us to use a virtual class room.
4533,Amazing
4534,"It was working really well but after updating the app,I can't login my account! Help me!"
4535,The app keeps freezing on my device.. the only app that is behaving like that.. Kindly fix any problems that may be causing this.

No matter if I write my assignment on the COURSERA PLATFORM or write it somewhere else and PASTE it there, it uploads as a LONG LIST of words WITHOUT any PARAGRAPH BREAKS. It's getting FRUSTRATING as people AREN'T INTERESTED in giving REVIEWS now. Even if I post a Google Doc link of my assignment, it's NOT ACCESSIBLE.... I've tried to reach you many times.

4584,Really good app and comfortable UI.
4585,Downloaded videos from course aren't appeared in the downloads. For starting downloaded lectures the app wants to go online/internet connectivity and then only i can watch offline videos. Please help me for how downloaded videos will appeared in download section.
4586,"Very good platform But assignment file upload doesn't work, just gets stuck indefinitely. Tried Word, PDF.. nothing works. Very frustrating to do a homework assignment and be unable to upload it... I am stuck in the course. This is such a basic, primary feature.. The web is filled with issues regarding the uploading of files in this platform, but none helped me. I find this ridiculous, as a web developer with many years under my belt: no error notification, nada. Contacted support. Hope for help"
4587,"The app is great and is user friendly. I would give 5 stars if it also includes the ""save note"" option, that is present in the desktop version. Please include that soon. Otherwise, this app is great."
4588,"After updating to the latest version, I can not log into my account with my mail address. Login button does not seem to work!!! I keep pressing it but no effect. Is this your ""more secure login"" system?"
4589,Very worst app They do not give feedback form our performance And not check our assaiement week in properly
4590,Good but lengthy video
4591,Good app with less flaws
4592,"A typical Indian user can't pay for subscriptions using any of the payment options except credit cards. Given that primary user base is teen students in their college life, how can they possibly have a credit card...!? This makes enrollment into specialisations a tedious task..pls consider accepting PayPal payments in India for subscriptions. Besides that the app is great üíì"
4593,Love the app! Love the concept behind this. Much better than others in the same market. You can even apply for financial aid to help you learn. THE BEST.
4594,"This app is really good. However, I think they can make it optimized for tablets. I can't use this app in Horizontal mode... the way I like it for Coursera. This app would be totally solid for me, if it's made for tablets... and also has horizontal mode."
4595,"I am facing sign in problem in Application, and web site also not loading. It's display single dot at the let top corner"
4596,Best

4606,"I haven't taken the course so I can not rate it. It sounds promising. First I would like Botany, Basic German, and Basic Spanish. One at atime as I can afford the courses. These are. Also after these studies I would like to study how to use internet better and a nother vocation on line. Rate you as promising."
4607,Very amazing experience ‚Äå. Thank you
4608,Best app for Knowledge
4609,Wow it's a great place for learning
4610,Totally trash.. it doesn't connect to internet even when I'm on 4G or using wifi

4619,"YOUR APP SUCKS!! I WROTE AN ASSIGNMENT OF 200 WORDS AND SWITCHED TO CHROME TO JUST SEARCH A WORD! AND WHEN I SWITCHED AGAIN TO COURSERA, THOSE 200 WORDS VANISHED!!!!"
4620,took a few classes already.. and my instructor was amazing. (Dr. Silverman) & I plan on taking more on the subject if they become available.
4621,Much better but sometimes wind up
4622,Great opportunities are there
4623,Login is awful. The whole prove you're not a robot is ridiculously long and difficult. Then after I did that it made me login again. Uninstalled.
4624,They have glitch while showing the quiz answers. It's Annoying. It's a time wasting app...the developer of the app should be hanged to death
4625,"I cannot open my coursera, my wifi is blocked. Turned off the wifi and tried using cellular data and i can open. I dont know why my IP is getting blocked by coursera. Currently enrolling to a course and need to finish immediately, and cant even cancel subs since i cannot log in to the coursera."
4626,App working smoothly but again payment options in India are limited
4627,Rahrig
4628,"Canceled a subscription immediately after viewing the first video in the course, but was charged anyway after the free trial. As per their unfair refund policy, I can't refund the money they essentially stole so I'm basically screwed."

4631,"Unable to login to my account, Both on website and the app in the last few days!!"

4634,Although everything is working fine but I don't know why I'm automatically logout after a period of time and I took almost a day after which I can login back..
4635,Very good
4636,Does coursera provide any free course along with free certificate...?
4637,Love
4638,Very expensive
4639,Just love it
4640,Awesome
4641,Love the app! A suggestion though: I hope Coursera puts a favorite button so we can save courses we like. I want to keep tabs on topics I'd like to enroll in later.
4642,I loved it!
4643,"Player is not up to mark, glitches are very common even on downloaded videos, sudden changes in audio. And slow, often prompt to close the application."
4644,I don't know why every thing worked smoothly but now each and every video is lagging....please look to this
4645,"This is phenomenal no doubt, but I don't know whenever I use this app my phone starts heating up, please fix this issue."
4646,Excellent app that I have ever seen.. with full of knowledge
4647,This is the most frustrating app you click on a course then when it says financial aid available try to click on it to do application only for it to take me to a page that has nothing to do with financial aid. Tried using actual website but it has a enter the sentence to continue enter the sentence as it says and it keeps saying please enter the sentence correctly including capital letters and spaces still nothing
4648,"Dont know why but, tried a lot it keeps on asking to check my email id or password evertime i try to sign in..."

4650,Good app to learn and enhance your skill
4651,"Nice app, but there are issues regarding activities and submission of assignment. I need to use browser to submit assignment, as the app is having issues. It shows not uploaded everytime I try to upload. It is also not getting updated. The browser data and app data of my completion of a course also don't match."
4652,"The app is very good and the courses on this app are very nice, but since from last few days means since last update my assignments are not getting uploaded so lots of time is wasted. So please fix it as soon as possible."
4653,"I'm not sure that whether this app can download courses I enrolled before or not ‚Ä¶ There is a new course I enrolled. Sadly, I found that the videos it contains can't be downloaded while reading materials were saved to my phone successfully. üò•"
4654,I have downloaded 7 courses all videos.. When I try to start the video.... It stops for fraction of a second and starts again... And it happens in all the downloaded videos.. Fix that bug!! .. It's so annoying
4655,"Never met a more frustrating app in my entire life. It can't handle most of the links in the apps and everytime it tries to go off app, I have to sign into Coursera all over again with about 15 recaptchas each time. I have abandoned it, my blood pressure is too precious."
4656,Very useful
4657,Good
4658,Such a pathetic app. I have heard a lot of good things about the app so I decided to enroll in some online courses. I tried creating my account but it is not letting me creating an account and I am only getting error message. I have tried 50 times still no success. Such a pathetic app.
4659,"I absolutely love coursera, but one star less for the app, I wanted to give three stars but thought wouldn't do justice for the content that coursera provides.

I hope you are familiar with the conditions of CE students regarding the campus selection in comparison of CSE, IT, ECE so i request you to provide more and more courses for Civil engineering students"

4670,Perfect
4671,"One of the best app on earth. I like this app. The education material they are providing is best. One can't find this type of education material on udemy, udacity and datacamp. One should have to install this app not the app like udemy and Udacity.."

I wasted so much time before since there was no rating system on the other app. You didnt know if the course was bad or not until you'd wasted hours or days on it.

4716,This app is a trash! Multiple times it's asking for relogin and also showing tons of never ending recapcha. This is most annoying app ever. Didn't expected such a trash from coursera.

4720,Great

4733,"Nice, however I've seen a lot of courses for other languages and yet German it's not one of them. Would be nice to have a German course for beginners for free.Dispite that it's a nice and fine app."
4734,I am currently just downloading this app and I hope I will not be disappointed but I just wanted to leave a comment to those people who are complaining that there is no where to write notes. Have they never heard of a pen and paper. If you are watching videos for 4 hours why would you not have a pen and paper ready just in case u do need to take notes. Would u not take a pen and paper into a classroom or lecture hall for a lesson that takes longer than half an hour. Simple but effective solution
4735,Very good learn
4736,Great app. Value proposition is just amazing....

4746,"I wish coursera app could add the option to download in low quality if needed. The app has a bug the downloaded videos when played again loses audio track. Both video and subtitles work fine . Please fix this, new issue video gets stuck for 1 sec every 4 to 5 sec"
4747,Love this app i love the app cause there lot of course for free for people who cant pay for the course im utilizing the quarantine time during this lockdown Thanks coursera
4748,I am not able to sign in
4749,Please properly update and moderate the app Coursera is a great learning opportunity It's sad to see a coursera on a broken app
4750,Glitchy
4751,"Good site to learn skills but the big probelm is the app, it is not smooth initial loading time is too long and the app environment is kind of laggy. That is the reason i gave 3 stars."
4752,"Wonderful courses and user interface also. I like coursera over edx, udemy, and other E learning apps"
4753,Why cant I see the topics on each week? I just keep seeing black white space.
4754,Good
4755,"Unable to login. I have a Coursera account. And I am currently doing a course. But I use Google Chrome for it. I decided to install the app for better interface, but it wouldn't let me log in. I can't even create a new account from fb/other email. I think the problem is within the app. Please fix it."
4756,"This is a great platform for learners who genuinely want to upgrade their skill set. They value the passion for learning and genuinely, it is the most required platform in today's world."
4757,Login error....
4758,Sometimes when I am writing peer assignment and by mistake if my device is rotated then who assignment is reset I have to write it again
4759,"I love Coursera, it's simply the best"
4760,Showed that network error occured but there are not problems with our network and logins :)
4761,Better way to learn new things.
4762,This app sucks ... They say that the certificate is provided and when you are done with your course it seems that you have wasted your precious time as you can not claim your certificate until you pay some cash üèß ...some don't have a credit card üí≥ or facilities to pay online ...it would be useful you don't download it.
4763,I am unable to login to my account.
4764,Great tool for accessing different courses. Smoothly usable
4765,Very bad customer support . I wound touch this app with a 10 foot pole.
4766,"Amazing, really great mobile experience, am hoping the progress bar gets updated to actually reflect the course progress like the online site"
4767,"Screen chops. Every once in a while, while watching a video lecture, the screen chops many times. The experience is very bad to watch."
4768,Good
4769,Nothing is better than this education app. Thanks Coursera.
4770,You can trust.
4771,Nice app for learning something new.
4772,Very informative best for programming
4773,stupendous üòòüòò
4774,It's really very good.
4775,Good learning app
4776,This is amazing and knowledge experiencing application.I have enrolled in 10 course which are very useful for me. Thanx coursera.
4777,There is no roof here... to what you can learn
4778,"Overall a good experience. However, when I watch videos on my android tablet in full screen mode the edges of the videos are not visible, which is very annoying. I wish it could be fixed."
4779,"Doesn't work in my Acer Chromebook with Chrome OS 83.0.4103.119. When the sign in/create new account dialog is displayed, the main window flickers and a second sign in dialog is displayed and it flickers as well. The only reason I gave it one star was to enable the post button in the review dialog."
4780,I'm able to do what's needed to be done without much difficulty
4781,superb app
4782,best
4783,The app the at least 10 mind to open...
4784,"An embarrassingly broken app. Sometimes the videos reset while watching. If the app is moved to background while watching (e.g. for taking notes), the video is reset. The app doesn't memorize the video position in general, so if one changes module and goes back, the old video position is reset. The module ""Resume"" functionality works only when online. What the hell!?"
4785,Would have given 5 stars for courses quality but I'll cut 1 star for slow loading (now a days)
4786,"I have certificate problem. I graduate my course but I don't get my certificate yet. Everytime there has verify problem and i can't solve this problem. If somebody knows, please helps me"
4787,App has become really laggy and heats up my phone in very short time. This specifically occurs when the internet connection is weak. But this wasn't the case a few months prior.
4788,"The loading screen and the loading of courses take like for ever compared to the last update which was snappy, the downloaded content doesn't show up in downloads section, then whats to point of having an offline& downloads option. The new tweak to the ui feels really good and much appreciated."
4789,Outstanding source of knowledge
4790,Good
4791,"As stated by many other users too same is happening with me also ,video starts to stutter playing right after pausing in between and it's very irritating please do work on this issue ASAP , it's really frustrating even after having app you have to use browser on phone or pc to access video content properly."
4792,Inappropriate charging for cancelled subscription. Pathetic
4793,Unable to download courses
4794,"worst study app, consumes unnecessary data without downlpading course contents."
4795,"There are some problems in the app. If I try to filter my search, it shows 'something is wrong'. Can't save a course for later while browsing. And it sometimes hangs, so have to restart."
4796,Slow and buggy. Please optimize.
4797,I don't have the words how to praise this application.I have invited more than 10 friends to use this application.Love you Coursera from Pakistan
4798,Very much useful for the students !
4799,Lag.and stuck problems
4800,"After Org Sign In, the course opens in a web browser. If its browser based then why do we need an app ü§î"
4801,Amazing app
4802,"I think that it's very useful, but I don't give it five stars because the app doesn't have the course notes option, I can't save notes from the classes, and neither can't see the notes that I have taken on the desktop version. And it does not have the option to see the courses that I have saved for later"
4803,Best place to learn
4804,Can you please add a bookmark option for all future courses we'd like to take. Pls
4805,Please make improvements in submitting assignments. It tells me that I have submitted the assignment successfully when really there is no file uploaded how the hell is that happening
4806,Bugs
4807,Best experience
4808,It collapses no matter what
4809,Brilliant for learner
4810,Love it!
4811,It's User friendly app
4812,Love it! I don't need the certificates so I'm enjoying learning lots of things for free.
4813,This app has helped me learn a lot of courses really easily. It is convenient and informative. The availability of courses is infinte. I would recommend it to everyone I know.
4814,"No words can describe this app, the greatest seeking app that i personally suggest. East or West Coursera is the best. üí™"
4815,The app is taking too long to open since a few days.
4816,This application is wondeful but the problem behind this application is when we used to see ofline videos the video lags which quite sometimes make you annoying and anger.
4817,Slow loading
4818,Very good app
4819,Error occurs while submitting/reviewing assignments
4820,Videos are lagging whenever we pause the video
4821,This is real good my college is providing us coursera real good videos and short quiz to make you learn and the professors are real good they provide certificate which is just cherry on cake you get good explanation assignment in some courses to understand it better and be able to apply what learned basic quiz based on what you learned and then you're done so easy and good
4822,I cannot login with my mail id..
4823,Nice website with high quality level of educational experience
4824,Annoying assessment locks... I have finished a module but I have to wait for 20 dayum days in order to actually finish the assessment. Please look after this.... This locking of assessment is really not needed. Today is 2Jul I have finished with week 3 of a module but I still have to wait for Week 2 assessment to be unlocked which is due on 20 July. This will only make students lose interest for learning if what they want to do is simply locked.
4825,Nice app for online MOOCs.
4826,"It is good but I couldn‚Äôt submit pdf/doc file in my peer assignment ü•∫, why this is happening? I also try from google chrome but still facing the same Problem......"
4827,Unerollment is not possible in this app..
4828,Nice
4829,I cannot access the quiz and therefore can't proceed with there est of the course. Been four days and haven't received a single email from customer support.
4830,This is a very good app for learning no doubt about it. The battery is drained like a bullet train if any download content is being played. Otherwise one of best if not the best.
4831,The app is very good.but there is a bug in the app that completed courses does not update...and i just want a favorite button.üòäBTW this is the one of the best platform.
4832,The save note feature is not in the app. It would be better if it is useable in the app as well.
4833,Convenient and usefully fully satisfied with the explanation of the instructor
4834,Stupid ui ux
4835,"The app seems to have problems with uploading the assignment section and also the peer review is not updated after its completion, missed my failing grade of a course that was 100 percent done."
4836,"Since the update, I can't even sign in. Keeps losing the internet connection. That problem was due to problems with my internet service provider. Now, I use the app offline. I download the unit material and tap aeroplane mode in order to access downloads rather than the online version. The answers to quizzes are supposed to be saved and graded once back online. This doesn't happen. I have to do the quizzes again online in order to get them graded."
4837,Great coursera team..
4838,Best learning app but course fee was very very high
4839,Downloaded video keeps breaking every second and it makes it impossible for me to learn what is being taught.
4840,Its helpful
4841,Excellent
4842,Good but lags when u download offline videos
4843,"Seriously a crappy buggy app, even though the lectures and the content are good, the tests are so buggy. I've passed a test with 9/10 questions correct, it shows me I've passed, yet it shows all answers incorrect, and doesn't even show which 1 of the 10 was wrong, by just displaying a blank screen for all the question cards. Really disappointed."
4844,Good for courses.. but not worth for the prices
4845,Great app to learn something new üëç... good content as well.....
4846,Nice experience but need wide range of courses
4847,Very Good
4848,I m facing the online problem in this software
4849,My downloaded courses wipes off Everytime and I have to download it again. The aim of the app is defeated then
4850,"Be careful with subscription! I enrolled the course but after 2 days I decided to cancel subscription. (It is possible only on the website). In addition I did everything according to instructions, but I didn't receive the confirmation letter. I didn't pay attention due to enormous amount of ads from Coursera on my email. Today I've gotten a receipt for subscription and unsubscribed one more time. There's no possibility to refund my payment according to Help Center. ;("
4851,Chargeable App
4852,Good app but having lack of courses
4853,Great platform of learning
4854,"I have tried for college students free courses but its always says email is not verified, i have contacted the Coursera team ,no reply came!"
4855,Guys please add dark mode....u better know why.
4856,Not useful material i suggest udemy .
4857,Android version :6.0 Kernel version:3.18.19+ Device:Lenovo-phab2 (lenovopb2-650m) App not responding.After that my UI freezes.I have to force restart my mobile to make my phone working again.
4858,"Issue on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9in, when playing video in landscape mode the aspect ratio doesn't fit the screen perfectly and content is sometimes cut off at the sides as result. Playing in portrait mode or mobile device are fine, but I wish there was an option to adjust how videos fit to screens."
4859,Awesome app but some features are only applied to pc mode
4860,It is not working properly
4861,Sync with Google Calendar doesn't work. Useless App
4862,"something wrong this app, i can't upload file. showing error"
4863,Horrible. Site can't be accessed online through PC or laptop and assignments are cannot be submitted through mobile app.
4864,"Bad experience , worst app"
4865,I have signed for some coureses on coursera app but when it comes to assign my work in workshop there is some error shown every time and i cant upload my assignment file please fix the issue because of that i am not able to complete my course and get grades thank you.
4866,I'm using this for a month now and I've got a good experience using the app. But I'm having some problems the past few days because the lecture videos are lagging even if you download it. You need to open and close the app everytime you pause the video just to fix the way the video lags and it's pretty annoying. I hope this will be fixed if ever an update will be available.
4867,Good
4868,It's really good. Some issues are to be fixed. It's more and more good over PC
4869,"Please, please bring back landscape mode so the app is useable on tablets!"
4870,Thank you so much free courses during covid 19. It's really a very useful. üôè
4871,Bad
4872,Really had a very bad experience You can't upload a file even if they says pdf only you can't even upload them then error will happen and and you can't have that assignment changed because it's already locked. Without any file the assignment will get uploaded.
4873,I am too much disappointed about coursera while I completed all my videos and quizzes they had locked my assignments...
4874,Excellent app
4875,Bhurji sher rajdut
4876,Good
4877,"Cant use the Verify My ID settings in both the web and mobile app. 1. Can't detect my camera in both mobile and laptop 2. After uploading my driving licence, it requested face detection/photos, and since it can't detect my laptop camera, it provides qr code, but when i scan the qr code, the mobile browser started process to upload by driving licence again 3. Cant upload or use the camera function on my mobile app and mobile browser. There is no selection to allow app to access my mobile camera."
4878,"Dark theme is missing, UI is a little bit outdated"
4879,"Coursera is one of the best platform to learn new skills, technologies, languages,etc from experts. It also have tough questions in assignments which needs high thinking ability."
4880,The best app to learn anything you want. Loving itüòç
4881,Coursera app is really good but it has some stability issues.when we open the app it takes more time to load and sometimes may fail to load the forrums.The offline video availability should have subtitles added to it so that we can use it offline more conveniently. I hope the team would take concern about these issues.
4882,A great platform indeed
4883,"Keeps lagging, even with downloaded videos. Please fix. Thanks"
4884,"There are few bugs in this app .... First of all ... When I save any video offline and start watching it , the videos start lagging after ... say 15-20 mins ..... Also by that time my phone gets heated so badly that I have to wait for it to cool down for around 5 mins .... And at last .... It drains the battery at a very fast pace .... I mean ..... This heating and battery drain problem with Coursera app is more severe than when I play Pubg .... Is it a joke !!!!! Disappointed"
4885,Coursera Best Learning App
4886,I used to study with this app of our Stanford university
4887,App is not opening properly
4888,Why it don't have play store credit as payment method? I don't want to issue credit card just this app.
4889,Good learning experience!
4890,Good Application
4891,I lovvvvvvvveeeeeee Coursera üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç It's the best learning ground for me üòÅüòÅ
4892,Good quality courses and well crafted ala carte
4893,Goooood
4894,Worst app design
4895,Good
4896,"Improvement advices: - Add bottom for store note ( as in website). - Allow to have a dark theme reader for the textscript or for the entire app. But have a bottom for storing text is essential. I cannot spend 4 hours watching videos on my laptop, for this reason the app should have same functionality or even more of the website :)"
4897,"Not very intuitive application, ther are no notifications or ability to give assignment"
4898,"Yo no s√© si todos los cursos son as√≠. Pero, cog√≠ un curso de dise√±o web y el profesor es un completo inepto, no sabe ense√±ar, hace tareas y acciones que no ense√±a como hacerlas pero a √©l le salen y a t√≠ no, aburrida la clase y solo logra enojarte y estresarte. No s√© si llegue terminar √©ste curso, pero √©so s√≠. Primero y √∫ltimo que tomo."
4899,"The best apps among the all online educational courses. Most of the coursers offered are free of cost. Helps you gain a lot of knowledge regarding any subject, be it tech or non-tech. Adds value to you CV :)"
4900,Best educational institutions all are in one app
4901,On the go learning!
4902,The maths formula are not given in readable form on my Lenovo Tab ... kindly fix the issue
4903,Great learning experience!
4904,Good app
4905,Best app for skills to improve
4906,"From last 2 updates the app is showing ""Something went wrong!! Pls check ur internet connection"". Well my internet connection is very much fine. it is working fine for other apps. Also it says ""error loading data"". Although coursera is a great learning platform, this kind of errors hinders the learning interest."
4907,It's good but yeah there are some flaws that can be fixed...
4908,Needs quality saving feature. Every time lecture changes I need to scale down HD to Low.
4909,The worry for me right now is if there's a special reason why I cannot access attachments under lecture videos on the app. I have downloaded all videos on my mobile. It doesn't make any sense for me to go on the web and load the videos again because I want access to the attachments.
4910,"Can't upload assignment (pdf, txt, doc, or whatsoever file) Can't review and grade peer assignment Limited access and results! Can't contact help staff"
4911,Really helpful
4912,Good app. Keep it up.
4913,The app version works very well. It helps to catch up with deadlines when one is on the move or access to computer is limited. I finished almost half of a 6 weeks long course through the app. Two thumbs up
4914,Awesome üòä Best Aap For Education.
4915,Works well. Very easy to study from my phone.
4916,It can't load in low Internet speed
4917,I just started using this app I'm so far happy with it. There are four modules that I'm expected to complete all of which are outlined in the beginning therefore there is no surprise do any of the modules. Is lays out the time frame in which each module should be completed and even counts down by the hour and minute. The videos are easy to understand and it's an interactive course meaning they asked the students questions you answer and then you could see the results usually in a percentage.
4918,Love Everything about Coursera. This is such a valuable MOOC and an App.
4919,Excellent app for enhancing the knowledge as well as earning foreign university certificates
4920,App start lagging after 5 min of watching video
4921,Excellent app for learning anything that you want to learn. Highly experienced and Nice explanation by instructors
4922,Worst app . Made me frustrating
4923,Amazing....
4924,The only app I've found that refuses to work on my Chromebook. Crashes as soon as I try to log in.
4925,Uploaded UI is very powerful and design is awesome
4926,Someone help me with Coursera contact(mail or contact) I was wrongly charged and there is no way to contact for refund inspire of cancelling the course well in advance. Worst online portal I have ever seen in my life!!!!

4928,Great app! :)
4929,Fantastic app! It gives a user friendly experience.
4930,I think the app should have a wishlist so that one can list the courses that they want to enroll later.
4931,1)It keeps annoying me by asking my id and pwd before sbmting each assignment and also that image verification process 2)Video doesn't resumes to the point where I stop instead it takes me back to start of the video
4932,"App keeps telling me that there is no internet connection, but I connected to wifi and use other internet services normally. The refresh button is disabled somehow, not clickable. Edit: Have just uninstalled and downloaded again, still get error."
4933,The app hangs again and again while starting....i have to uninstall it everytime....it just suck...can the developer make it right....i really got irritated
4934,I would appreciate if the app has auto rotate functions. Not everyone using the phone one way only.
4935,Good bt very expensive
4936,You guys should add the option to sign in with multiple accounts.
4937,It's great app that make person skill full
4938,Excellent
4939,"Courses are good , everything is great but I can't access to the course after opening the app . I have to clear the app data before opening the app to access the content . It's so frustrating"
4940,"Please add ""Add notes"" option in android app..."
4941,‚ù§
4942,Amazing app !! I am really greatful that you have included in video questions in the updated version !!
4943,Nice
4944,I couldn't able to do anything properly...
4945,"One star. I cannot even use the app. Doesn't download the course, if choose ""Download course for offline Coursera use"" the whole app doesn't use internet because I turn on the function even if I enter with internet. My University do partnership with you but I cannot even use it."
4946,"Courses are good, but very bad experience in using app."
4947,I like the course so far but.. is it possible to add a feature for taking notes like the desktop version? It's a very important feature for me.
4948,Really really disappointing 1) Web version show the course is free and when i check in app it's not 2) web version has badge free but now both apo and web version don't have that badge 3) now they are charging fir everything like for enrolling in any course . .... They are not what they used to be sad ü§ê
4949,The courses here are amazing but it glitches a lot. It doesn't show the courses tour doing sometimes. Please fix it
4950,One of the best platforms for Massive Online Open Courses.
4951,"Splashscreen lasts for over 10 seconds, although their content is nice, using the app with low internet speeds is pathetic."
4952,Great app. Features are really user-friendly.
4953,"Love all the courses, easy to follow. Great way to up your skill set."
4954,"Awesome experience ,valuable content"
4955,Good platform to learn.
4956,"It will be great if you fix this lagging problem asap,so that I can get back to learning from the mobile app."
4957,Great learning ü§ò
4958,I already purchased 1 course and as I was not able to do it for some time and now when I am trying to start it they are again asking to purchase. I tried to contact on help centre but they are not even taking my complaint I did course before as well it wasn't like this ever turning in to bad service.
4959,"With coursera, learning never stops"
4960,"An amazing platform to widen your learning experience and make your resume worth a while with the certificate u achieve after completion. Go ahead learners, grab the opportunity to learn more."
4961,"I love this app, I'm so grateful for every professors who share with their outstanding knowledge."
4962,I can't use the app.. it says I dont have internet network but I can use courses via website
4963,Error occured while accessing quiz.Please try again ? What is this error..i was on the last quiz of the module and am facing this issue The name of the course was initiating and planning projects
4964,Really great!!!
4965,Amazing site. Helpful. Informative. Best in comparison with tedx and other sites. Highly recommended site.
4966,Option to download certificate is required......
4967,A Great app for Learning & Accessing courses from Leading University. The content is easily accessible and relevant. However the app is unable to optimize tests and course content on App. They should work on it.
4968,good
4969,I am unable to unenroll from courses!!! Please help.
4970,Overall it seems good but needs improve to make it user friendly
4971,"Works pretty well, but freezes up on occasion."
4972,The best app l have downloaded ever
4973,"Worst ! Unable to log in , just keep loading infinitely...hated the app...web is pretty good."
4974,This is one of the best online learning plate form to learn different kind of stuff and there a great variety of courses to pick up I like this app soo much also I have learner many new skills from this
4975,Downloaded Video keeps on breaking after every few seconds...not working smoothly...the in memory cache is also too high...not properly managed memory...üòê
4976,Aaaaa
4977,"Didn't have the courses I was looking for. It's not like it was even obscure. I'm looking for full stack or front end courses in React. Pretty popular query. Oh well, I guess I'll look elsewhere."
4978,"App is not working properly I am able to use in laptop but not in mobile,academic content is pretty good"
4979,"There should be a system to set up the video quality that I want to stream with. I mean there should be a option to set the quality in settings, and it will work automatically in every videos, and I won't have to change quality in starting of every videos. And videos don't rotate automatically while watching, hoping you would fix it too."
4980,I like coursera from the very beginning. The new UI is looks very good.
4981,The reason I am giving 4 stars is that while pausing the video for taking notes and then start it after sometime it start lagging and offline mode doesn't work as expected. And rest is nice . Mentors are top-notch and materials too.
4982,Excellent app for growing
4983,It's good for learning but we can't compete our assignment plzzz improve this problem quickly

4987,"Hi, coursera. For some weeks i haven't be able to access coursera from any platform, either mobile or web. At first, I thought coursera was down. Then i checked and it's not. I turned out that my IP was stopping me from accessing coursera. I don't know if it's because of the regulation of my country (because they blocked some other ie. reddit etc) or something else. Now i can only access coursera and continue my courses through VPN. I think other people may experienced this same issue too."
4988,Best
4989,its good
4990,Best hai yaar full of knowledge üòçüòç
4991,This is being absolutely a mind boggling app if yu need a good marketing or brand knowledge there videos are amazing.
4992,"Full of crash, not loading and complicated."
4993,Wonderful platform to grow up technically
4994,My business experience started here.
4995,The app starts lagging after one I watch one video. And then it crashes after about 20 minutes after this recent update. Please fix this as soon as possible.
4996,Hi I'm ganya I did enter my app
4997,"Userfriendly,informative Give it a try"
4998,"We are living in Malaysia since 2013. In the beginning I wanted a job but I didn't have enough experience. I heard through unhcr about coursera. At first I didn't have any idea how it works, but after one week i felt that it's very useful and helpful for me. I have done 5 different English language courses. It's amazing, I got confidence and started a new life. Thank you so much coursera and unhcr for giving me that amazing opportunity. Love you all."
4999,"Hell lot of problems, spent my time more on reaching help rather than gaining knowledge. Bad experiencw"
5000,It is an awesome app. Coursera has made learning so much easy and productive. I would request the developer to please enable notes taking service in Android version. Just because of this I have to take written notes which is very time consuming
5001,Content is awesome....
5002,On part of knowledge it is quit good..But there are some issues in downloading sector
5003,Wonderful
5004,It just crashes now on my phone.
5005,"Amazing app to learn, have been using it for almost a month now."
5006,Unable to understand
5007,Good app
5008,It's a great app to learn professional and competitive coding
5009,Unable to login. Not able to change password. Unable to access coursera website. Udemy woops your @$$ üëéüëéüëé
5010,"The new UI is pretty good, but why can't we rotate the screen to both sides in landscape mode. It would be much easier for me, to hold my mobile other way around."
5011,Good but lags a lot
5012,Best app. Ever üíô
5013,Disgusting app We cant even edit the information in ths
5014,Good
5015,Great intuitive UI..easy to use .the offline features are great
5016,Super
5017,It worked good for 1 day and then it crashed every time I tried to use it
5018,"Since few days back, sometimes after opening the coursera, it doesnt get way past welcome (coursera written on blue screen)"
5019,"Its a good online course plat form... gave quiz, assignements with a.. regular gap. Honestly did correction on time...."
5020,Can't login to the app. But logging in through browser is possible
5021,Best app for learning
5022,A great learning platform. Thank you Coursera.
5023,It is a good app for learning. But I found problem in downloading sector. Most of the time I can not download contents. Please solve it quickly.
5024,App is getting crashed while watching videos..
5025,üëç
5026,Very good app
5027,Very easy
5028,"It is fantastic, easy to learn and many interesting courses"
5029,"For an app to promote education, they should take some lessons on app development and work on their pathetic app, which won't even let a user login even if the login information is correct"
5030,The forum takes a lot of time to answer.
5031,Needs a dark mode UI
5032,Great learning experience. Coursera is definitely on my list of top 5 favorite apps for 2020.
5033,I enrolled myself in a course via audit feature. Now I want to buy the course in order to get ther certificate but there is no option for that. I am not able to buy the certificate.
5034,please add dark mode
5035,"The content is really good. But the app could do better. First of all, it'd be much more helpful if we could be able play and pause videos using the button on earphones. Second, the app really lags and becomes awfully slow when you download the courses offline. Autoplay for the next videos can't be disabled. There are stability issues with this app, I'd recommend using Coursera from the Browser."
5036,Very nice.I really like it.
5037,This app causes a lot of problems and annoys me much not able to load any courses..even though I have high speed internet
5038,It has a good or appreciable content bt at the last moment when i m performing the test or review of the chapter it is not submitting the ans and that problem is happening since last 2 weeks Good for learning bt at the time of cerificate it just bluffs
5039,I wish cerificatttes that I gained from this coursera will not be a deterrance for my workplace to accept them if they are not fake nor real.
5040,Great app for learning
5041,Exceptionally useful.....!
5042,"Good,...."
5043,Worst app too slow even my phone is 4gb ram it works slow worst rating .... we can learn course it's good but the app works slow
5044,"Misleading information. Even don't know where Buddha born. Don't know about other courses but in Buddhism course some wher they provide totally false information. please Google "" where is lord buddha born"" you will find, how false information this app provide you. i request you all reader please shear this Gautama Buddha born in Nepal not in India. please healp to save small country in global map."
5045,Very bad app
5046,Best app for online course
5047,Worst application ever takes too much time even with fast internet connection
5048,This app is gonna make me rich.
5049,Superb
5050,Everything fine except ID verification... I am facing problem while uploading ID.
5051,"This app is easy to use, works smoothly and has really good data optimization. I prefer watching the lecture videos on app and solving assignments on their website."
5052,Nice app for varieties of courses
5053,"I did a course on ""Using Databases With Python"" and it's been 3days, and I've not got my certificate, though I've completed it fully n properly. Also the help section of the application is not working."
5054,Hands down amazing
5055,Super and exciting educational app
5056,"The current version is disappointing. I can't watch one video on the app without it lagging. Works fine for the first 2 mins and then starts to lag, the voice breaks and becomes difficult to understand the content of the video. Poor app experience."
5057,At the beginning it was perfect but now its starting to crash and slow down a lot and load slowly.
5058,Is there any option to rate this app for half star? Such a worse ui/ux design... The app gets hang for every 2 mins of use and have to close n open for smooth experience... Prefer UDEMY over this worst learning app... Paying money is worth to learn in udemy instead of enrolling in coursera!!! Please fix the bug if possible... The download option in this app is the worst of all... Wont properly function at all and uses lots of data for downloading nothing! Such a pathetic app!!!! Prefer UDEMY pls
5059,"Good app but I faced problem in assignment..when I copy assignment link and paste it in forum it doesn't turn to link, it just turns to some blank words..please look into it"
5060,I great platform to learn exciting things
5061,Can't upload file
5062,"Courses are satisfactory , but the thing I felt it is short of is, courses heavily lack practice questions and exercises, more practice content (more good if they are real and practical in nature or industry level exposure) , heavy testing to complete courses, so that, in the end student really can appreciate that couresera course really transformed his/her life. Video based learning can play it's role in learning upto some extent only, it cannot make student think on his own."
5063,Please make the video to be able to roate right also.
5064,Nice app very smooth and interactive ui unlike competitor apps. Also very good in app content.
5065,This is a great app to study but not in free. They can distribute free certificate to devlop the usage many users.
5066,This app is useless
5067,The app is very useful and very good. However speaking from the app perspective... The app heats up my phone really bad and drains my battery easily. You guys must do something about this issue
5068,Awesomeüáπüáø
5069,"There should be a bookmark option to pin a course and come to enroll later. Also, the offline mode needs more work. I experienced sometimes no photos or nothing at all using offline mode."
5070,0 customer support.. Pathetic experience.. Courses are also not up to the mark. Many modules take you through online reading and book discussion.. Waste of time.. I experienced that the content they are offering can easily be learnt through you tube unless you need a certificate to show on your table.. I don't recommend it to anyone..
5071,Good
5072,Great for self developement and education... Haven't experienced anything as good as Coursera.... I do prefer the use on laptop instead of phone though..
5073,"Videos bug. Other than that, everything is perfect"
5074,It's all paid.
5075,"I completed my first course in under a week, but it was a five week course, and I also completed a four week course in under a day. This I like!"
5076,Nice
5077,Marvelous. Love it üáßüá© ‚ù§‚ù§

5080,Best learning app
5081,good app

5084,Excellent platform for Knowledge Enhancement & Learning
5085,Goood

5129,I'd verification isn't working. Worst experience. It starts from first after I uploaded my id. I am tired of it.
5130,A wonderful platform however The only thing they should add is bookmarking or saving-for-later for their whole catalog of courses as its difficult to compare them or even find them later if you cant go through with them in your first go.. which is hardly possible.
5131,"Please give the feature of downloading subtitles in the application. You've it on the website. Once we download the course, we need subtitles to watch a course video. Thank you"
5132,"Really disappointed with the payment system. I didn't know that a course fee is being charged every month. I didn't even want the subscribed course and got charged twice, atleast the team can set up a reminder system before charging an account."
5133,I love the web version of cousera buy this app is the worst I'm not able to verify my account and the same problem is in web version also I have completed many courses but due to the verification I'm not able to get any certificate's plz help

5174,"Best app to learn, all the courses are worthy"
5175,Wonderful app. Great features. The only problem is that my phone heats up after I'm into few minutes of a video. Then the video and audio starts lagging. I have to restart the app to get the videos run smoothly. This is the case for even videos that have been downloaded for offline watch. Need a fix for this!
5176,Yes maybe super

5182,A brilliant thought provoking course I am enriched with the knowledge.
5183,Coursera is a huge part of my life. It is kind of baffling how the app version of it falling behind in portable space. The web version that I use on my phone via chrome has more options and functionalities such has taking notes or participating in surveys but the app version is so restrictive and limited that using it becomes very frustrating. We need a better app. Coursera deserves better.
5184,Sometimes it crashes
5185,Content does not download. Neither it shows how much time is left. What % of individual videos have downloaded. Very poorly built app. Not expected from those who teach these things.

I think it's giving me time for rest seriously fix this bug.üòÇüòÇ Jokes apart, but (2) When I start watching videos, my phone heats up like a small heater, everytime. Thank You for the rest.

5195,Extremely helpful for online learning .
5196,Wow factor
5197,Need video pre buffer feature to be included While watching remain buffer need to download based on network.

5221,Best learning app
5222,I had enrolled to 11 courses at a time. When I reopened the app they just disappeared. Then I opened their website on Chrome. There is a section on their website called 'Updates'. I found my those enrolled cpurses there. But I don't know why they don't have 'Updates' feature on their app. And also don't understand why my courses disappeared from 'My Courses' section in the app. Also not having a 'Wish List' feature is also problematic. Needs lots of improvement.
5223,The app was working very well before last the update my courses won't load it keep saying check your internet connection although i have pretty good internet connection (mobile data as well as wifi ) search option works in the app but can't load the course please fix this bug/issue as Soon as possible since we need complete the courses in time

5233,Good
5234,Unmatchable!! Undisputed!! User-friendly So far Coursera has been the best online learning content provider. Only competition to Udacity (in some cases better than udacity but lacks only thing which is career services & support)
5235,No need of big PC if you have this app. It's totally reliable.

5254,Good app
5255,The app can't access my quiz to move forward in the course and there's absolutely no way to contact anyone directly to resolve the issue.

5265,"This app is pretty good actually. Simple interface & easy to use. But there's one thing that I would suggest. What if you add a wishlist tab? It's kind of tiring when I look up for a course and interested in it, and since I have several course going on I have no time to take it, so I have to write the course name down my notes to enroll later. It would be nice to have a ‚ú© or ‚ô° button to save the desired courses. Or something like youtube's Watch Later. Thank you, you guys already helps so much!"

5587,Worst app ever. No proper customer support available. I had not verified my ID and name verification was doing great for a couple of certificates. I hadmy whole name on the certificates. I didn't fiddle with my Name verification and went for ID verification and automatically only my surname is getting printed on my certificate. I tried contacting the team via their contact us messaging feature but no replies yet. And they have mentioned that ID verification is permanent. I don't know why.
5588,"Full of errors, cant comple a course."
5589,"After the last update, all courses all modules all videos are facing with video lagging. Second by second lagging."
5590,"Superb, I like this app"
5591,Excellent must go for it.
5592,Coursea is unarguably the best learning platform anytime any day. I had both platforms COURSEA AND EDX installed long before the lockdown but I started utilizing them properly during the lock down and I'm shocked at how much I've missed overtime. I'm overwhelmed at how much I can learn at my own pace from advanced schools still staying connected with my peers. All thanks to Coursera and technology ü§ù.

5639,So great
5640,This app is a dream come true!
5641,APP needs help. Could not access well on a tablet or smartphone. Did not save progress or course notes. BEST IF RUN WITH A BROWSER and using a computer. Your app needs help if using a smaller device.
5642,"Do companies actually read their own users request for assistance and investigate issues with their own systems? I don't think so, as they continue to give answers that had nothing to do with people request and claim users and not them have to do something. As I mentioned there are bugs as I had trouble opt out and Coursera support claim phone software does prevent some access to courses. Ah what has opt out of newsletters had to do with accessing courses? üò°üò°üò°"
5643,Very very good app.easy to use easy to pay.lot of learning
5644,Unable to log in
5645,Too much lag in applications as well as in video. Unable to watch lectures properly.
5646,I want to ask the coursera community that in my course if there would no assignment to review then would you able to give the certificate or not
5647,"Excellent app... perhaps, the best for learning"
5648,"The app continuously saying 'please connect and retry. How am I writing this if I am not connected? Fix this bug, please."
5649,Very good
5650,The lessons wouldn't load?
5651,I am finished my course but he say that you have left 0m
5652,Personally recommend for any course. this app has great UI download feature and clear after you complete week and synced reminder overall simple but great learning experience
5653,"The courses are good , but this issue of a msg comes , too many requests , you are temporarily blocked as you have made too many requests,,, pops up when ever I take a look at the video or do the quiz ."
5654,"Good content, but needs some features. It would be nice to have the ability to save screenshots to notes with the ability to type in some notes if needed. It would be nice to have picture-in-picture as well."

5662,This aap is not for useable
5663,Unable to upload audio file
5664,The courses would be great but many features don't work on the app and you need a computer to access which makes the app pointless.
5665,This is the best online learning platform I have ever attempted. The courses are not complex and just require some studying on your part. I love how much Coursera has helped me obtain new skills to change career paths. I am grateful! Thank you for offering such a wonderful platform! I can't afford to goto school and don't have family. This makes it simple to earn certifications for jobs in tech if you focus and do the work.
5666,"This is a scam app. Don't add your debit card or credit card details here, they will deduct money from your account without permission & then will say it's not refundable."
5667,You can learn where you want.
5668,Browsing the courses became too hard in this update please return the previous browsing method!!!!!!!!

5690,"Super dick app with hell lot of bugs...dear Mr. developer, you must take a proper app development course for yourself and get trained with how to create a stable app."
5691,Our coursera app is not useful . Coirsera provided free courses college university then application not said that or inform that . Then appllication fake not useful

5696,Good online learning platform
5697,Can't browse other courses! Did the same search on the coursera website and its working well but application is not working properly! Fix the explore option in application
5698,Worst help centre ever seen and after ID verification I have completed 2 cousre but after ID verification my name on certificate is wrong after complainting 3 to 4 times aslo they arre not replying or giving help support they are so back dated that they dont have email address or proper people's to solve query

5702,How is that possible?? This app shows same account for two registration IDs and then shows error!!!
5703,This app is loading 1 time out of 10 times. Very difficult to carry on with courses
5704,ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
5705,"The app often crashes or cannot load courses. It's also quite difficult to navigate or explore many courses available, and we cannot see introduction video of a course unless we visit the course page via website. While playing course video, the app doesn't remember our progress by duration, so if you for some reasons have to stop playing the video halfway, you'll start it back from the first minute once you get back to the video."
5706,Doesn't download course content ie. doesn't work.
5707,Animations format not supported and they are not running Please fix it
5708,Unable to log into account on the app
5709,Playback stops randomly when listening downloaded content with screen locked. An optional feature to automatically skip interactive content would be nice to have a non-stop listening mode. Currently the screen should be unlocked every time when playback stops or interactive content needs to be skipped. Speed setting resets when a lesson gets skipped so it needs to be re-adjusted every time.
5710,"Your Application is awesome for studing courses anywhere, even in offline mode. 5 start for that. Dear developer, I am unable to solve programming questions of assignment. Mobile : Samsung J7 Pro"
5711,Good platform and informative to learn technology in computer science

5718,Doesn't load content properly.. works slow
5719,Best app for online courses.
5720,Course can't load itself. Stopping every second. I know it might be temporary issue. That's why giving 3 stars. Solve it and get 5 stars.
5721,I can not even sign in anymore.
5722,"My only issue with this app is during the course, the discussion modules are not opening. Also, I cannot enroll to various specializations on the app. I have to use the Coursera website. Also, I'm having issues downloading PDF's. Hope these problems are resolved soon."

5725,"Login doesn't work correctly, nor does password retrieval, nor does linking to Facebook."
5726,"The app is good, overall experience is nice but most of the time it fails to sync the progress I've made offline. I like to download videos and watch them as I get time but most of the time it either fails to sync or it takes a long time."

5728,I can't login with my organization. I receive a network error.

5732,Lovely
5733,"App needs lot of improvement. Always lagging, dont refresh often and some time when i watch multiple videos one after another some videos are still shown as unwatched (even when i watch it again). Having a very bad experience."

5763,This is useless always saying no connection and try again
5764,"Terrible app, won't work. It won't load pages unless you click so many times on Retry. Keeps crashing all the time. I can't even make a search because it just simply doesn't load. Also keeps saying it needs network connection even though I'm connected. Just garbage"

5780,After the id verification your team changed my Surname and no response after complaining about it... N received the certificate with wrong Surname.
5781,Ive paid over 100 dollars for courses in here but yall wont give me my certificates because your id verification refuses to work no matter how many times ive tried it or what device i try it on im beggining to think this is a scam

5790,"This app has alot of good courses and would love to take benefit of this but, Each page a lot of time in uploading. Though my net is there it says please have your net connected. I cannot be a part of discussions of my course due to this. And most importantly it takes a lot for a page to get uploaded and comes with an error in the end asking to close/wait/refresh the app."
5791,"It sucks that peer reviews matter so much. No matter how well I do it, some guy posts a very bad review bringing my score down because he thinks it's bad and says sorry that he was strict. He says my works sucks becoz it's so hard to understand. The other guy who reviews me says it's too easy and simple. WHICH ONE AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE? Peer reviews are useless. And I hate that it dictates my scores."
5792,Best learning app ever.
5793,Coursera is so far the best app to follow courses. It is organized and can be well understood by users and FREE TOO
5794,Good solution

5825,"Can't log in. Says ""network error"" when there is patently no network problem. Uninstalling."
5826,"App itself is ok but the content marketing course ended upp being very disappointing and frustrating due to coursera practices. 1. heavy reliance on podcasts and videos which it did not provide within the course itself or links to 2. no way to contact presenter, ucdavis or coursersa and get a response or fix 3. peer grading is a nightmare. Will NEVER take a coursera course again! update. you can find the extra podcast and video downloads if you go through the browser instead of the app."

5866,"the payment of subscription of the course Google IT Support is being denied to process from your end.this is causing problem's to me as I am not able to pursue that Course,Same problem has occurred during my ongoing course of Python For Everybody by University of Michigan.Please look into this matter and do the needful to process the payment as soon as possible to avail my subscription"
5867,Good
5868,It is the awesome app I ever wanted Good luck for future. Thank you so much to bring such a Funtastic course. I have a question why there is no option of shearing to my friend ?
5869,Great way of learning.
5870,"Back then a year ago, Coursera used to offer lots of free powerful courses. Right now, the app is all about making money. Only a few boring lesson are now free. What is worse is the fact that all regions pay same subscription fees. Different regions should pay different fees because Per Capital Income (PCI) varies among Nations."
5871,Great!
5872,I can't view assignment critiques (comments) on mobile. Coursera emails telling me I have feedback on an assignment I submitted direct me to the assignment submission page and my only option is to start the assignment. Assignments I turned in on my computer sometimes show as unsubmitted and overdue. Coursera is not well suited to the course I'm currently taking (script writing).
5873,"Good app, but the full screen video is cropped as only part of it shows"
5874,Video is buffering evn with a good data.. app is crashing many times
5875,Best for everybody
5876,Great experience
5877,While I try to download the courses mobile becomes too hot and while watching videos of j charge the videos the video lags. Using redmi k20 pro.
5878,Good
5879,I. Cant aford
5880,New version of the app is unable to load videos
5881,ID verification is not working
5882,Great for Learning
5883,A fine place for knowledge Dining..‚ô•Ô∏è Could have given 5 star but I think Coursera should update it's certificate graphics...make it more professional and attractive.
5884,"Got a few courses free due to college , very informative and user friendly support team"
5885,"It's really a very good app, because you can study any topic, from institutions from around the world. With certificate it charges some money which is reasonable too and you can even do without certificate, while you can study the whole course."
5886,I have completed a course but I can't access it anymore How to access it
5887,Amazing app üëå Very important... Must install and take advantage of free courses
5888,Use full
5889,One of a kind app . Learning from top universities is something great that this app is providing that too for free
5890,nice
5891,"Worst user experience in this app,when I'm trying to watch a video,it is being paused automatically,it is still continuing even I tried to play it,totally disappointed üòî"
5892,very nice app
5893,It crashes after sometime or get hanged
5894,Crashing while watching videos ... frequently
5895,The app does not work properly on low speeds. It hangs a lot. Downloaded videos takes time to open. It sucks on lower speeds!

5897,Gut
5898,amazing app
5899,Fantastic appüòé
5900,I loved the application.
5901,Incredible
5902,"Useful app, but PLEASE add dark mode feature to make the offline mode more comfortable and less harmful to the eyes , especially with amoled screens ."
5903,Downloading is too slow. It's downloading 27mb from last 4 days. I don't get this. üòí
5904,Best platform to learn various courses across thousands of subjects.
5905,Worst app i have ever used Never give card details the deduct all your üí∞ they are just some greedy people's took the materials from Google and just paste in it
5906,Tracking information and sharing it with facebook. As if facebook needs to trak more of my informations and usage.
5907,The app does have a lot of online courses and is one of the best e-learning platform. But the customer support is the worst. Have to wait for hours to get a reply for your query. and the assistants are not supportive.
5908,"Love the app, however there's an error that needs to be addressed. In the questions with multiple selectable options, the app tells you that certain unselected options were correct or that you should have selected another, and cuts points for those. But when you reattempt the quiz, it says what you selected is incorrect. And only gets fixed in the 3rd attempt when you don't select the incorrect ones that the app asked you to select in the first place."
5909,This app doesn‚Äôt response usually....
5910,Excellent
5911,Excellent course and online class. Superb coaching with valid certiifcates...

5918,Thanks for your service.
5919,App is crashing a lot after the last update
5920,I submitted Assignment using my smartphone.I wrote it as points in the right order.But when I viewed my submission in the web version it seems to be messed up.I want to know the reason for this.Please do check.
5921,Very good app and very good courses.
5922,Best online platform ever
5923,I completed my course one week before still i didn't recieved my certificate üòñ

5925,Very nice
5926,Best of the best
5927,I really love this app. Thank you for providing free korean language lecture. It's Easy to understand and easy to navigate through lessons
5928,"This app is very slow it sucks many times ,cant believe it has courses to build apps and the app of coursera itself is waste."
5929,Excellent lessons from great teachers

5940,Amazing app
5941,Great way to widen your knowledge as you don't need to do the actual degrees. There are so many courses from so many universities. Coursera is excellent.
5942,Awsome app

5947,Good luck
5948,It's one of the best apps for online courses. Do support this app. üëç
5949,This app helped me a lot
5950,Unusable on 4:3 screens with 16:9/16:10 content. The frame just gets cropped
5951,Why I can't log in to my laptop once I have log in into mobile
5952,"Coursera app Needs to get better as soon as possible ....first it don't Show India in Country Timezone settings ...where we have to mark timezones according to Respective country ...second at the Time of Assignments , app couldn't even generate question , attempting them and submitting is after work .I had to submit Assignments by going to website ...Plus it don't show your progress properly and Saving course offline is also a hell work .Please it's a great Platform No Doubt but do something"
5953,üëç
5954,Works great; learning alot
5955,Really made good use of idle time in quarantine by having access to great online courses that are relevant and individually tailored to suit needs and pace. Thank you! Great app!
5956,Best app for online courses
5957,"He aprendido bastantes cositas con esta app, amo que el curso siempre est√© disponible a√∫n si no pagas. Hace que sea muy entretenido repasar conceptos."
5958,Good
5959,Can you make free or discounted for students for certification so That we could take more than one or pay later after getting ajobüôè.
5960,Great portal for e-learning.
5961,looks like app maintenance have not been performed since ages ...untolerable
5962,Peer reviews should not be graded based on a Peer's subjective feelings towards others
5963,It is amazing
5964,"Awesome app, but doesn't give advantage to Indians like me, we can't purchase the courses. So, I think it should be worked out."
5965,Super educational experience....love it...just oudio problem ...
5966,Poor ... difficult to reopen in Nokia 3.1
5967,Wow....its very useful..
5968,Best!
5969,Online support is very fast and reliable .so happy with the kind of service they provide with customer care.
5970,Coursera is the best!!!
5971,"Apart from videos, nothing really. Lots of useless notifications. Eg. one comes with ""Your assignment has been reviewed"". Tap on it and nothing happens. When I tap on the assignment in the app, it is a video that starts. Not even possible to display certificates."
5972,Good learning app.
5973,Good app for courses
5974,It's a collection of courses right at your fingertip.
5975,Good
5976,"Coursera as an app in function, design, and content is great. It used to be very generous and was a wonderful educational tool. However, the more time has gone on, the more obvious it is that the educational aspect of the service has been compromised for profit. Of course there ought to be compensation for the different universities, institutions, and for the creators themselves; but perhaps a subscription-based service would be more equitable and consistent with the former values of Coursera."
5977,"Good day, this app skips whenever I make use of the offline mode...I am unable to hear the tutor well"
5978,I didn't received any certification after completing programming for everybody course
5979,Please free the videos we do not have money for the food please due to lockdown

5991,After the recent update a half of my paid course do not apper anymore in this app; have to access them on my desktop only; bizarre and highly irritating
5992,Good
5993,There are some in MCQ while answering the correct answer it shows wrong.. same thing vice versa it happens
5994,Awesome
5995,Thanks Coursera for the great app
5996,Awesome
5997,Very worst with forget password it keeps logging in to your account but not let you change the password.
5998,It is more expensive a middle class student can not afford it
5999,"Very good app, better than I expected. I have been using Coursera for several weeks now, but am only just trying the app. The only things I wish it had are (1) a wishlist function to save courses you'd like to take later and (2) a way to take and save notes (or even better, use the notes function built into the website). Other than that, great work!"
6000,"I enjoy taking Coursera classes because of the setup but I encounter inconvenience in accessing this app since helpful features are not available. Uploading files for assignment is always unsuccessful; I use my mobile browser instead. Peer feedback cannot be viewed too; same as the downloadable files in video. I did not know there are downloadable handouts until I used my laptop browser. Also, the updates are inconsistent; my grades does not reflect yet even if the browser shows otherwise."
6001,It is very educational

6012,Very Confusing App
6013,Productive
6014,Good
6015,"If I download few videos to play later when the connection speed is less, it doesn't work well as expected. Looks like it tries to establish connection very frequently and waits for it. Even if you click on a downloaded video, it doesn't play immediately. What is the purpose of downloads then?"
6016,Nice
6017,Didn't use it
6018,"I am not able to buy the paid cource, I need help"
6019,Good
6020,Cannot continue any courses after disabling flight mode. The app just asks you to check your connection.
6021,Resetting your password for access frustrating.
6022,Alert (saying that my university can track my progress) from Web view not closing as its comming continuously.
6023,I rate it one star because I am Mining Engineering student and I want to grow my skills and knowledge to this field but in this application there is very few topics that are related to mining engineering....
6024,Love this app. Gives you a great basis of understanding many different topics of interest. Some are free and all of it very helpful. Thank you so much for this app.
6025,One of the best app ever!
6026,Great initiative
6027,"Coursera is a great platform to learn. But I really hate the fact that the app only runs on Android OS 5.0 or higher. What about people who don't have that? Futhermore, even the website doesn't work properly on my device. I can hear the lectureand read the text, but when I scroll to the video, the website gets blank. I rate it one star because I had a very unpleasant experience with the app."
6028,Excellent
6029,More than exllant ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüî•
6030,Please add dark mode.
6031,The app sucks. Continous network error and crashing.
6032,Very bad site.. They have deduct the amount of courese from my card in my free trail period of one month without any information..i request to not to access this site..they are fake people and even not replying of my query..
6033,I can't thank the developers enough for this app. This is one of the best app for students and all those who arr looking for knowledge. It is very helpful in acquiring professional skills.
6034,Grait
6035,After payment it says failed to join course
6036,Excellent
6037,The app is wonderful but i have problems when i want to upload images from my assignments
6038,It is full of insights from a variety of resources and subjects of real life focus.
6039,Enlightened
6040,"It's good, but still web version is far better than app. And regarding search options, it would be better if you could add option to filter courses."
6041,The app is not downloading even after 100% download completion. Team pleaee check asap.
6042,Most courses for free! Amazing app
6043,Great app & needs further development
6044,It ia one of the best app for online courses and certificate is also issued after the completion of the course.
6045,Improving my knowledge and skills alot by this coursera
6046,It's really awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
6047,Bkvas
6048,Payment not accepting. Less support uslesss app
6049,"Awesome! They have done a really good job in making the app. Best learning experience -with offline mode, lectures and quizzes. Coursera app is the best courses' app. It has tons of features along with smooth experience and nice UI."
6050,good
6051,Not working smoothly
6052,Nice
6053,Good
6054,"I'm using this app since 2019.It's really awesome.When I tried to open some video by searching on Google for online course, due to some technical problem in my phone I didn‚Äôt open it,but using this app,I overcome the problems successfully."
6055,Very good
6056,"This app made possible by all the good souls out there who think of sharing with others, a group of most positive people out there"
6057,Best site for online courses
6058,This is such a wonderful appüëåüëå I really enjoyed doing different courses over here. I highly recommend you to be a part of this platform.
6059,Heard a lot about this app through my professor and gave it a try and yes its lovely
6060,Very important app and great
6061,Nice app
6062,When an app expects you to sign into your Google account. I think it's a hacker.in fact it's a sign that it's a hacker because I'm already signed in put it that way.too he who created. this so. Nice try otherwise. Prove me wrong
6063,Useful but expensive
6064,"Very good But, practice questions are not coming"
6065,"Useless, app has not worked since late February."
6066,"After the recent update, this app has become totally unusable. I download weekly content and watch it. Before the update it worked fine. But since the update, once you watch a video for about 4 minutes, the video begins to stutter and lag. The only solutions that works is you have to quit the application and clear it from recent apps and start over again. I have tried all sorts of tricks but this is the only trick that works for now. It wastes times and demotivates me."
6067,This app makes me rage bcoz there no free programming courses for me. I want to make games and write my own program. Unity 3d is a free engine i need a free course to develop my games. The courses were free in December 2019 but they are not free anymore. Why? You are taking advantage of the people bcoz of this pandemic.
6068,"Just perfect, but I would recommend to fix the issue related when you are through a downloaded video which has a Quiz on it, since it doesn't appear."
6069,Excellent app to learning something new and develop skills for buisness
6070,Its an amazing app with great materials...making courses more fun and easily available.. thank you for creating such platform :)
6071,Hate this app
6072,Thanks a lot for making this course. I am very grateful to have this in my phone. This is the best app. I loved it so muchüåªüôèüôèüôèüôèüåº‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
6073,Please introduce amoled dark mode in your app. Absence of dark mode discourages me to use the app at night. Please ensure the widget also gets dark. Thanks. Keep it up.
6074,The people who put this together deserve credit for trying to actually help people gain access to knowledge to information to education that otherwise would be out of reach for millions of people. This is a platform that brings information and education to millions of people who once before could not have access to it. So they deserve five stars. This thing isn't just slapped together with no heart and no soul. A lot has gone into this to set it up so people can truly learn.
6075,They ask you to become a tester? Than they dont give you credit and always sell your privacy
6076,Great effort
6077,Bug on asus zenfone5 device. Videos didnt have sound at all while its normal on the web

6083,Please please add more psychology courses professional certicates and master track certificates. I wish they had professional certificate for psychology as well as they had for IT and data science.
6084,"So far, I really like this app. I've only started so I'm browsing the offered courses a lot to find courses that interest me. I'm missing some sort of list that I can put courses on that I might want to take later. Kind of inconvenient having to look for the courses all over again after finishing a course (given I'll remember them at all)."
6085,I have started to audit the immunology class and watched 6 sessions. When I attempted to return to the course I was unable to continue.

6100,I can't register and start it always says failed to join course. Please try later. Please fix it.
6101,"Great course offerings. The app should also support landscape mode anywhere, not just only on some pages so that I don't need to keep rotating my tablet back and forth. It'd be great if this app also supports Save Note like the web app."
6102,"I have been trying to download this app since today,all to no avail.Dunno what the problem is."

6156,"I have one notable inconvenience with the app, I was just browsing courses and you have this big Enrol button in the bottom of the screen, while I was trying to press the Back button of my device it seems my finger pressed the Enrol button and with no confirmation what so ever I was fully enrolled, I find this unsatisfying there should be some kind of confirmation method, anyway I enjoy coursera it is an amazing platform keep up the good work !! üëåüèª thank you."
6157,Good
6158,frustrating bugs
6159,Slow speed
6160,Great.
6161,I loved it
6162,Why don't to add INDIA as country in location database? As you have already added rest other countries except for INDIA?
6163,"Don't know how is it in tablet, on mobile android Coursera does not work and Learner support useless, briefly! Just one star for beginning"
6164,Good
6165,Best plateform to learn..
6166,"I installed coursera app and It did not work. I wanted to Create New Account but the app saied that :"" There was a problem processing your request, please try again later."" I tryed again thousand times but it was not working."
6167,Learning is never exhaust! Thank you Coursera to making a great app to learning and exploring the newest technology.
6168,Main moto of the app developer to make money.
6169,Great
6170,wonderful and amazing app for first time users
6171,very useful
6172,This a very helpful app for learning new things including new languages. It may take some time but at last your very fluent in the language you are learning. I recommend installing this app as you can pass your time in learning something new instead of doing nothing. üòúüòúüòúüòúüòúüòú‚åö‚åöüòúüòúüòúüòúüòúüòúüòú
6173,Good
6174,"Please provide for stacks/lists( as per the default categories of the enrolled courses ) option in MY COURSES section of tha app( as well as web ) to arrange the enrolled courses in different categories for better navigation . Also provide an option for sorting the same by different methods( alphabetical, added etc ) and customizing the stacks/lists( by creating new one, naming, priortising etc ). In short try to make MY COURSES section less hecting and appealing."
6175,"The app heats up my phone so much that it is uncomfortable to hold, and takes up so much of battery rapidly (when I'm using it with offline downloaded content, I'm not sure of online). Also, it freezes while seeking or switching videos."
6176,Best aap for developing skills
6177,Great
6178,It is a very good app.I recommend this for all the people around the world
6179,Best app for learning new course.
6180,"Some great content. App looks to work well at first, but the sheer amount of bugs while trying to learn makes it unusable."
6181,Amazing Experience with this app
6182,thank you
6183,"App is nice, but video player can be improved especially watching speed. Can you include the feature of 1.75x like the PC"
6184,Excellent
6185,Containing lot to learn and improveing yourself
6186,Very good
6187,"Some serious issues when we download lectures. Site takes long enough to open When we are cancelling, its going again to homepage.not letting cancelling download Something not right"
6188,Just love it
6189,Good
6190,Awesome!
6191,"I canNOT verify my id, the app does not upload the image!"
6192,Best app for one who wants to learn skill and gain knowledge.
6193,Really great for free study
6194,What the hack is this üò¢ I tryed to sumit my qusses and assinment but only thing i can see is error and this problem is not solveing and my deadlings are at the door step.even the only way to contract cousera is nowa. Please solve my problem
6195,Waste app.don't use

6197,I love it
6198,"Bem legal, d√° pra aprender muitas coisas!"
6199,Excellent courses!!
6200,I love it!
6201,"Good app but with a very frustrating bugg. I can't watch videos on my tablet with landscape view, the app will automatically zoom in into the video and crop the sides out, so I can see basically 70% of what is actually on the video. Please fix it, I can provide my system log if that is helpful."
6202,Unstable. I can't take quizzes because the app keeps freezing and crashing. Video works fine though.
6203,Good app. Content loads a little slow even if it's already downloaded. Please add a setting to set the default video streaming quality instead of having to change it for every video.
6204,Great Gestures.
6205,"Can't log in. I enter my email and password (made sure it's correct each time) and it always says ""Login error. Check network connection"". My connection is fine. No other app has an issue atm. I also see that this app hasn't been updated in a long time. So clearly the devs have abandoned this."
6206,"I like the quality of the videos. Also, the reading materials are very understandable and simple. It's a good way to spend my work from home, more effectively and fun."
6207,Wonderful
6208,The class progress on the mobile app is not sync-ed with the class progress on desktop... That's the annoying part
6209,One of the best learning app....
6210,"Wish I was able to do more with the app version, instead of having to go online."
6211,Good
6212,Just fantastic and anyone could get a lot out of it.
6213,Nice one
6214,Oh
6215,It is slow and does not display course progress. Fix your backend guys before teaching others how to create services in cloud
6216,Too bad experience
6217,It was ok until it's last update but now it has started lagging while playing videos or reading lecture slides. Not a very great experience
6218,If that was get a 5-star but there is a few minor chords that forced me to is my laptop or desktop to handle classes. If they find a way to work that out it would most definitely be at five star app.
6219,Best So nice
6220,great
6221,It's good
6222,This is one of the best app for online courses. This app provides you the views and understanding of professional people. So easy to understand. No annoying ads at all. Not much fee affordable and the best thing it let the people to enrol free who can't afford the fee. Totally love this app best helpful.
6223,"Learning xp is awesome on this app, as it is intuitive and exciting each of content is, thank you coursera team, keep it up!"
6224,"Really liked the way assessments are designed..also if you try reaching out forum for any queries, teaching staff replies quickly."

6227,love
6228,An amazing app actually much more than just an app. Can actuall make you a better person .the resources it is providing with the quality is simply admirable. You can learn anything you want on this app.
6229,Good

6247,This app is not downloading in my Tablet That is why I am giving it one star üòë
6248,Very useful app.
6249,It's a great app with audit option for all courses. I'm very grateful to the Coursera community. Thanks.
6250,"Good,"
6251,You said courses are for free due to covide 12 Corona . You mislead us. Why !!!
6252,What more can we ask for? The very best learning app ever
6253,"i can't use the search filter in my Huawei y7! please fix this problem quickly __update, the problem has been fixed, thank yall üôèüèª"
6254,I really enjoyed learning courses in coursera Thanks you So much for your valuable topics
6255,"On video quizzes,, sounds does not play"
6256,It's incredible how much there is to learn for FREE. Absolutely insane. Keep up the hard work guys
6257,"It isn't free and requires payment, unlike both edX and Khan Academy."
6258,Loved this app
6259,Not running
6260,"I like coursera, but...Video player is horrible. Video is truncated at left and right on my tablet in landscape mode. It is all fine, but when you have text on the video it sucks. Have to use it in portrait but in this case video takes space equals to phone size. It would be great to have fit screen video player, so that it will have black top and bottom, but video won't be cut."
6261,Good
6262,But not sync with website
6263,"Simply waste of time i cannot access my assignments its showing error and lots of bugs it is very much disappointing.Why we are paying the amount for access the assignments,It is not suitable for android mobiles."
6264,I can't download the video.
6265,This app is constantly making sign back in. Disrupting my courses and continually making me start back over.
6266,Awesome
6267,The best of the best app and at the same time is also useful and free. Thanks for creators
6268,Sound quality is not very good in app And quality control problem
6269,This app is simply amazing.. Wow you can do free courses in a variety of fields.. This is the first time I am writing a review bcz this app really deserves a Lott of appreciation..
6270,I think to give an feedback option to improve or implement the app by the given feedbacks
6271,Good one is
6272,"I am unable to login to my organization portal through the application, it is continuously loading for hours and still no progress. Please help me with this."
6273,"This is a great app however, it doesnt have much information on learning the Japanese language only Chinese and Korean."
6274,"Great courses, very bad app"
6275,Can't login. Give error every time
6276,"I can't see Chinese subtitles and transcripts. It writes ""The transcript is not available in English. Please choose another language."""
6277,The best digital education platform apprently serving the enhancement of humanity. I like the way they always let the courses audit. This function is very beneficial for educators like us who are living in an LCD country. Thank you team coursera. :-)
6278,There is no option to download assignments in the mobile app which is a big disadvantage in my opinion
6279,Good platform
6280,"This is absolutely amazing!!! It lets you be in control of what you want to learn, and has so many different options, and you can do it all on the go!!!"
6281,The app is clean and working so far for me but lacks the note taking feature that iPhones and the desktop website have.
6282,Best
6283,nice
6284,Like the new design.
6285,Perfect
6286,I am using this courses since 2014 and I really love it.
6287,Wonderful!! Useful and easy thanks
6288,i took a free course ( certificate not included). it is vedio based. very interesting and useful. I recommend this app to anyone interested in online learning.
6289,"I cant write decimal points in quiz mode..android 6, samsung note 5..the numbers keyboard doesn't have decimals"
6290,Great
6291,I always get an error message when I click on the play button. Can't play videos even if I download them.
6292,Video is not clear I am so disappointment and I deleted the app
6293,I just updated the app yesterday and now I couldn't save/download videos online anymore. I reinstalled it and still having the same issue.
6294,It crashes sometimes and Takes alot of time to opem. Otherwise its best. Please add other payment options because Not all people have Credi t cards.
6295,Amazing
6296,This updated app is far better than previous one.
6297,Informative
6298,Pretty cool üòé
6299,"Love this App, and currently doing a few courses at the moment"
6300,Good content
6301,Best app for online courses
6302,Not working!
6303,Amazing!!üôåüôå
6304,"The app shows a button labeled 'Enroll For Free' on every course and specialization, but for some of them clicking it leads only to a paid subscription screen ‚Äì that's clearly deceptive."
6305,Good
6306,Great app
6307,"What a waste of time Tried to take a course using a browser on Android and it was impossible to answer video popup questions. Downloaded the app and watched 3 videos on the prof's side hustle, prompted to buy a membership, pay for the course, blah blah, and now quiz questions won't even load. This is my second disappointing experience with Coursera I am done with this garbage. It reeks of time-share style tactics. Do not recommend!"
6308,Very good
6309,"Google python course, in assignments/quizzes section program assignments not working in app . it's working only in pc . worst app √†pp is not useful doing this course"
6310,Nice
6311,youtube. go
6312,"I love it!! So. Much. I really enjoy the range of subjects, and the course I am taking in machine learning is so well paced and engaging-highly reccomend. But even better than that is the service!! I messed up a setting about 10 minutes ago, I contacted the live chat (it's 11pm at night here in the UK) and boom its all working again. These guys are the absolute best"
6313,"Tried cancelling my subscription to content I hadn't and wasn't going to use, as there was supposedly a time frame I could cancel before it would charge. It then charged me days later, after the refund option was no longer available. I had decided not to join the course I had planned to, but I know now that I don't intend to use this service at all after this."
6314,Fun

6316,Awesome content
6317,When I enter company url and login.. everytime initially it says sign in error. Please check network. I have 100mbps speed. Then second time it spins infinitely and does nothing. While doing it if I rotate screen signing in stops. Please test app thoroughly before releasing it. Very poor experience right at logging in. I was keen on extensively using this app for courses and I have got just 1 week to complete many courses.
6318,"Very wonderful, providing easy and convenient facilities for studying anywhere."
6319,"The app is great. However, recently when I open this app my phone stops operating. So I have to restart my phone. I don't know what happened with it."
6320,The app is amazing and I was really enjoying it but now there's some type of problem and I can't play any of the videos anymore. Or open anything on the courses
6321,"I love most of the course, expecially some of John Hopkins Uni, Thanks so much! Can you add 1.75 speed? That'll really help"
6322,Screen rotates one way only in landscape mode.
6323,"Great app, widget doesnt always auto refresh tho"
6324,"Great. But it's one of those tricks they say free trial, I was signed up for 2 different certificate programs so when I canceled the one I initially signed up for, the other one remained active and charged me. Requested a refund ( even though it says no refunds, I figured this is a weird scenario that would qualify for a refund ) and they will not refund me."
6325,its very satisfying
6326,Good
6327,Can't we Audit the course?
6328,"Definitely grateful, has almost anything you want for free and if needed for a fee. Highly recommended."
6329,App doesn't work on note8.
6330,Perfect
6331,Made my career
6332,The app doesn't work right üòë. The app doesn't show the my courses tab and also explore tab. I uninstalled and installed the app again and now I can't login. Please help.
6333,I would recommend courses to my friends.
6334,"The app is great, but it was really frustrating for me to realize one can't save notes there. I hope you'll add this tool, I've got so much used to it on my PC."
6335,Needs speed controls in Chromecast. It is a pretty good app but lots of professors talk too slow to absorb what they're saying
6336,Excellent app
6337,Great courses .. Rewarding. Informative and refreshing
6338,this app is one of the best apps i have come across so far. i installed it months ago last year 2019 and up to now its working very well on both my android phone and laptop too. i can choose any course i wish to do at any given time. i also get a chance to learn for free and do assignments and submit them for free and in case of graded exams i can purchase them at my own convenience and do them.well done google and the team.i can recommend this app to anybody who has an interest in further studies either by introduction to courses or research or more resources.
6339,It's good
6340,I really love the app and the courses provided. I have a passion for learning languages and thanks to this app I have done 6 diplomas in different languages. App is very easy to operate and I really enjoy using it. Been using this app for a long time and never had any problems. Just one suggestion. Is there any chance to add Korean language to the list please? I really recommend this app. Thank you.
6341,Brilliant
6342,Awesome
6343,Please bring a dark mode.
6344,"Hi developer, please add feature to download individual course videos just like you can on laptop. I'm the current app state we must download an entire week at once. Thanks. Great work"
6345,Very helpful app
6346,Application is lagging very much. I had to force stop and relaunch the app.
6347,Horrible login experiences even when your password is correct. It keep show images for you to tag. Horrible.
6348,Excellent app for the courses
6349,It is crashing soo much in my lenovo k6 power smartphone.
6350,It's helps me manage my courses on coursera effectively. I especially love the download feature
6351,Pop by
6352,It looks like we can cast this app to screen if we have chromecast. But is it possible to do the same to a fire stick also?
6353,I wish it could remember video progress.
6354,"Best app ever, changed my life"
6355,Best app ever... I love it
6356,Exceptional work
6357,haven't had too much experience with this app yet people do you make everything difficult
6358,Very good app. Even website is also equally good.
6359,I have been using the coursera app for about 3 years now. I found it a very good source of online learning. It is also very good for supplemental learning for face to face learning. I am heavily indebted to the developer(s) of this wonderful educational app.
6360,"Coursera is a great app. However, I keep losing saved course videos once I close the app, which is quite awful."
6361,Very good App
6362,Very nice app and very good quality courses are available. Those who can't afford the certificate course can easily use the audit course option and learn things.
6363,"Dont know yet, just downloaded it."
6364,"App is not working properly, namely, course material and tests not loading right. Recently switched from iPhone, where the app worked almost perfectly. This is not even close. Surprisingly the one thing that was an issue on the iPhone app is the only thing that works right here on the Android app."
6365,"In the quiz , where I need to type , it's not visible. Which means I can't use the app offline even though video can be downloaded offline."
6366,Please add option that we can increase size of subtitle
6367,"All the deadline dates are in US format, very confusing."
6368,The most important app in the store
6369,Ushering in a time of enlightenment.
6370,"the ""save note"" option which is essential for online courses and is available in the web-based coursera is missing."
6371,"It doesn't work any more on my Mi A2 device, keeps crashing on launch itself, thus making the app totally unusable. I have tried cleaning app cache , uninstall then reinstall.. it just doesn't work. I have shared the crash logs also, please fix this as soon as possible."
6372,Used to work but now crashes immediately on startup.
6373,I don't know
6374,I just love Coursera. It gives me the opportunity to enhance my knowledge to blend with the existing knowledge and apply to real world opening new insights. Providing most quality education is simply amazing thank you
6375,Excellent üëç
6376,Cant install it.
6377,I love it
6378,Works well with Chromecast. Running transcript stays synced as well which is appreciated
6379,Perfecto!üòâ
6380,"The app kind of just doesn't work. It doesn't load course materials so I can't do anything. It typically softlocks my Note 10+ so I have to do a force restart, because it tries to load course material, doesn't, and just loads perpetually, preventing me from doing anything else."
6381,Best free online learning
6382,There's a bug where the choices for some questions are missing. I lost some points because of it.
6383,Great app for learning
6384,I thought it was just enticing advertising when Coursera mentioned that they provide financial aid to students who can't afford to pay for the certificate courses. But I just saw that I have been approved for financial aid! I can't express how much that means to me. The app and its services are certainly top notch. Can't wait to start my Indigenous Canada course with the University of Alberta! ‚ù§Ô∏è
6385,Iam unable to open the app. It is getting closed automatically....help me out
6386,"Me encanta, tiene cursos muy proactivos e interesantes."
6387,This app is good. It gives me the lectures that i wanted to understand or learn. But this app is not made for offline purpose. Yet i have downloaded some video lectures but my video is laggaing . And when i try to download more lectures the app getting slow . After some time the start to not respond.. My youtube channel is Critic Master One
6388,Good experience &Thank you to come of my life.. I am learn a new skills and a lot of opportunity.. Thanks coursera &university of london
6389,Love study love learning love to collect certificates .study is every thing if there was no coursera no education this is the best app ever for study
6390,the app keeps shutting down within one second of starting...
6391,I couldn't open the app. It crashes every time I launch the app. My device is under Android 9
6392,Very good
6393,Its a home of knowledge
6394,The app fails to connect to the internet even with a valid connection. Please fix it.
6395,Awesome app
6396,Frustrated because the app just keeps on crashing.....
6397,"Is requiring you agree to have your data shared with 3rd parties. It should be optional but that fact that it is mandatory, or our profile will be deleted, speaks volumes."
6398,Nothing new in new update. The app is still crashing
6399,This is still best app for coursing.. Hope there's another payment method for certification. Coz not everyone have cc.. Google play payment will be awesome.
6400,Wish the app would go into landscape mode. Navigation to see all the courses is lacking. They like to point you to courses they think you will like and hide the ability to explore others.
6401,Espectacular
6402,The app is crashing every time i try opening it. Please fix this.
6403,"Great app,just wanted one more feature of adding notes which we can do on laptop .it would be great if we can save notes on phone too."
6404,The app works in general but it feels like a slimmed down and buggier version of the desktop web experience.
6405,My one of hoy grail is to make learning free and this app is doing in same . So nice N good . You r making change
6406,It doesnt work in offline mode
6407,App keeps stopping everytime kn mi a2 device. Please fix it asap
6408,The most bugged app I've ever seen
6409,"I can view course, but not do courses, I still have to do thework myself."
6410,I m bht bad experience with Coursera because the community which is provided by them is not good. And my experience for course crash course on python by Google very bad.
6411,The app is crashing on my mi A2 Can u help fix that
6412,Wonderful learning app. Easy to navigate. Clear videos and text. It's a wonderful learning tools. I love it.
6413,App crashes often in Android. However great courses available in Coursera.
6414,"why the code i upload can not be seen by mentors,remove this bug it is so irritating to upload the code again and again"
6415,"Version 3.5.1 , the latest is crashing on my phone on launch. Xiaomi mi a2 with Android one."
6416,Full pack of learning...
6417,its not free find a course then sends you to a pay 50 a month
6418,"Though the app is working good , Filter option is not there while searching the courses.I hope u will bring that soon."
6419,Can you do a wishlist feature for the courses that I want to take. Both for the site and the app. I think that would be a really good feature and I believe that everyone will agree with me on that.
6420,"I think, as least I know I would, appreciate it if I could get access to my notes I take during the course through the application, and not have them only accessible through the computer."
6421,Best application i have ever found.
6422,Simple to use.
6423,app keeps crashing and site is not working as well... please fix these issues asap I've courses pending.
6424,"Why is it mandatory for our data to be sold, i mean shared, to 3rd parties. It should be optional."
6425,Ok
6426,Keeps crashing even after latest update
6427,I can't thank enough for the contents.
6428,Good experience üòåüòå
6429,Keeps crashing
6430,App keeps telling me to load data whereas my internet connection is good
6431,"It is a great app, but unfortunately it isn't opening in my cell phone (a relatively new device). Very sad, because I used to study with Coursera a lot! :("
6432,I hate new user interface and the old version i am using is always asking me for upgrade i loved the basic coursera app and i am still using it please do make the app as simple as it was please help.... it's really fuzzy user interface and the old interface version 2017-2018 was damn awesome
6433,Nice app.. should implement continue video option...
6434,Crashes immediately. It started happening after my Android One update.
6435,No reply even after reporting repeatedly crash on a course.
6436,"Coursera as a platform is great but the app is bad. Full of bugs, lack of proper tracking and difficult to submit assignments and review peers."
6437,Whoow !! There Betty . Can't be speaking of my experience iant had yet. i wants ta get me some schoolin program and things like that ta know. Good timen too. Start of learning season.
6438,"Great learning app with download capabilities, so you can continue lectures offline."
6439,Excellent materials and useful classes. Exceeded expectations.
6440,awfully aslow when it comes to downloading materials to view offline. Really.gives me a headache
6441,App keeps crashing before I can log in. Sometimes it crashes immediately after I open it. I can't use it at all PS: I've deleted and re-downloaded it and it still crashes.
6442,"Love the courses offered because they don't feel like recycled material that you could find elsewhere, too... and also encountered excellent customer service from them! Highly recommended."
6443,Its really effective app
6444,Superb app for those who need knowledge I am so happy to learn with this app
6445,"Any application is expected to have some bugs. However, bugs that hinder learning in a learning app should be high on Coursera's list to fix. Yet, two very simple bugs have remained unfixed for the several months I've been using this app. The #1 thing that would get a 4-star rating from me: the ability to set ""no subtitles."" Frequently the subtitles occlude what the teacher writes, and I have no way to turn them off. To get 5 stars, I want the watched/casted videos to consistently check off as ""complete"" in the list of videos when they finish. Right now, they do not, and there is no option to manually set them as ""watched."" Thus, you can lose track of your place, and waste time trying to find it. Those two bugs annoyed me throughout the DL Specialization because they hindered learning. In case it helps the developers, my primary way of watching the videos was to cast from my Pixel 3 to the living room TV."
6446,Good opportunity maker... I like this app...
6447,"This is a great app. Don't be stupid, get it and use it. It has helped me a lot in learning new things. I use my Samsung note for this, and it works just great."
6448,Great learning experience
6449,Still need better interface in app and make it more smartphone friendly
6450,The worst I have seen. It says learn new courses. And it doesn't have maths and logic part at all. Disappointed.
6451,It has so many bugs. During some assignments it tries to relogin without any success after multiple attempts. It is slow. I download course to be able to use it without internet. And no I must observe all the lugs in application. Ask you engineers to watch some courses on your platform.
6452,Please fix app crashing issue.
6453,App crash
6454,"Can't disable the language subtitles, no option available when I click the button"
6455,The app keeps crashing in Android One.
6456,Course contents are not downloaded
6457,"Love the platform, but the app is a bit frustrating, esp. the video player -- keeps stopping when out of focus on Android Pie. Also, it does not remember my place in the video at any time, which can be irritating. Also, it would be better UX to allow a toggle for completing the readings, and optional homework."
6458,Best education app but little bit complicated to navigate
6459,Thanks alot thats great
6460,Coursera has become a money driven scam with marginal content. They'll take your money and then change their terms. Better off with Edx or an accredited school.
6461,Thank You! I am very grateful!
6462,Excellent
6463,"Not good. My android phone version is 6. But whenever i try to create an account or login, it tells me login error! No mobile network. Pls work on this, because it is reall frustrating!"
6464,It's really a wonderful application. Thanks
6465,M m9 z sz
6466,Excellent App
6467,I would have rated the app more if there was Picture in Picture mode on the app.

6472,It's good but the courses are quite expensive
6473,Nice
6474,Not opening app in mi A2 that is Android one
6475,I'm using android 4.2.1 and this app doesn't work :/ I can't log in.
6476,Can't able to open the app. Immediately crashes after opening the app
6477,I love the Courses Which is Available in this Platform. It is best place to Those who willing to learn
6478,Love it.. Very educational.. Really interesting app
6479,Installed crashing down uninstalled.. Again installed with hope but nope again crashing down crashing down.... Came here to give what u want ‚≠ê
6480,"The app used to run quite well on my MI A2 device. Yesterday, I updated my device. Thereafter, it crashes every time I launch it. I cannot figure out the issue. Tried restarting the device and uninstalling and re-installing the app several times."
6481,Good app. Lots of informative courses
6482,App constantly crashes.Fix this as fast as possible.
6483,So much useful
6484,"Very pleased, I'm actually taking a course on line that i was deciding on which I needed which helping me, the course is only 6 weeks, and truly enjoying the course. And this doesnt occupy my time which I can chunk size it, and still get other things done. I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to take a course in a time with a busy schedule."
6485,App is constantly crashing.
6486,"I cannot see all details on my tablet, because video fits on the screen cutting the edges."
6487,Interesting application
6488,The latest update keep crashing...Fix it asap!
6489,"App is constantly crashing and it isn't opening even after trying several times , it's been a week now."
6490,"Amazing, it gives you just what you need. Do check it out it has the best courses available."
6491,On my device (Asus z500m) it doesn't display correctly when I rotate the screen.If you could please fix this issue I would be very grateful indeed.
6492,Love it
6493,Just love the content. Especially machine learning by Andrew NG it's just the best course for a beginner in the field. The best part is it's free of cost and the content is of high quality.
6494,Cool
6495,"It is a blessingüôè thank you for working hard to generously offer this wonderful platform. I enjoy using it and functions well to my internet connection, even I'm able to learn, save,... offline. Respect for this who dedicated their time knowledge money just name it!"
6496,App crashes when it is launched
6497,"Coursera is really good for online learning. But the customer service so far is so terrible. I have problem with my activation of course after my payment, and I don't even find a place to submit my problems. I pay for the courses but unable to start the course right away?! No contact me button on the page when the instruction says you may use it to contact with service center?!"
6498,Its the very good app and will make life easier but there is a drowback of this app that we cant our assingment through this app thats why i am giving 4 star for its drowback hope that in future it will improve. The content of the app is available in English. There are NO drceptive ads and I am spending more time in this app than expected. You can Download your content and watch and read it offline wherever and whenever you want.
6499,prefer chrome browser interface
6500,I enjoy using this app and all its learning possibilities. The only set back for me is not being able to take notes with it on my phone like you would with the computer version. I found a way around that by utilizing screen shots.
6501,Best
6502,"Mixed opinions about this app. LOVE the website and the courses they offer! Fabulous! however, it doesn't play nice on my tablet. For example, on my tablet important content is often OFF the page, it doesn't allow me to take ""nice"" notes and frequently rests to some other note or won't save. As well, it is super slow even with an excellent internet connection. I prefer the online experience but OH so wish the app functioned better so I could use it away from my computer too."
6503,After the update I lost all access to my account The app refuses to let me log in
6504,Good
6505,"Without any intimation I was charged for subscription. At least you should give a proper notice for the charge. I was not at all happy with the course and now on top of it, I am getting charged. Worst ever experience."
6506,Just wow
6507,Thank You Developers
6508,It's not opening since yesterday?
6509,Good for education
6510,Desktop website is much better than app.... App was not responding correctly
6511,"App is generally good. I mostly use it to view videos and go through materials on the go. Layout seems to be fine, and works with mobile. But I'm deducting one star because there is some issue that it can't seem to download offline materials through wifi. It always download just a fraction, and then the wifi-signal indicator turns or be inconsistent (i.e. no transmission). Not an issue of wifi since the signal is quite strong and I could download and do other stuff without problems. The only way I could download offline content seems to be using data only."
6512,App crashes when I try to open it on my cellphone
6513,Annoying full screen that keeps on popping up. Uninstalled.
6514,It is extremely difficult to take notes (feature available in desktop site) on the app. Almost impossible to take while watching video. Please develop the feature or add a tutorial to easily access the feature
6515,Ease of use and accessibility whether online or offline!
6516,"Good app. I liked it, but in which folder are the offline courses located on my device ?"
6517,"I love the idea, but this was clearly not made by educators. There is no logical flow, there are mistakes everywhere (sorry, little oopsie notes are no substitute for actually fixing mistakes and providing correct information), and the presenters are pretty awful. Google is great at tech stuff, but this thing leaves a lot to be desired."
6518,Nice good learing app
6519,Great learning app !!
6520,App says no course registered. Though opens in browser.
6521,Keep up the good work
6522,"Amazing interface, I find it very useful as it keeps continuity in learning process when you cannot use your laptop for some days."
6523,Auto-recurring subscription models are a complete scam.
6524,Videos are not updated with the technology they are teaching. It took hours just to match the material.
6525,I haven't chosen automatical subscription for my course but this app does this through free trial and each month it charged me 49USD. I want to report this problem to request this app to give the participant to agree with EACH subscription EACH MONTH.
6526,"No architecture? I'm really surprised that there is absolutely nothing (zero courses) on the topic of architecture. Meanwhile there are no less than 100 courses on anything related to a computer, software, or data. Just a thought. Add architecture courses."
6527,It's a good app
6528,Nice application
6529,"Coursera has been very good in getting quality online classes but of recent, when using the offline option with the videos downloaded, the videos still breaks and it could get frustrating. Please look into it."
6530,Great app for learners
6531,Everything is paid ! Why do u even call it a free course.. I read a post wherein I saw Coursera as a app for free learning & then here I see everything paid...! üòì Although there are wonderful courses.. for premium ppl... Pay & learn üò™ü§êüò£
6532,Cousera has given me the greatest desire of my heart to learn about climate change. Thanks very much I will forever be grateful!
6533,‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è

6535,Enriching experience.
6536,It's such a great initiative!
6537,Great
6538,Nice educational app.
6539,a lot of useful and free courses. online learning at best
6540,"Generally, the app is great. I wish I could have a wish list to manage the next courses I would like to subscribe to."
6541,Educational app
6542,Too good
6543,Very Informative and useful with good proffessors.but cost for courses are quite high to pay for students
6544,Even though I have downloaded the videos the playback is not smooth when you have bad signal reception. Its next to impossible to understand what instructor is saying. This app was probably not built for offline experience. If you are not on network then app won't even show you your enrolled courses. It's no big rocket science to cache some of the data locally and make the offline experience better. Please relook the offline experience
6545,Very good informative app
6546,Definitely not free
6547,Their courses are pretty nice and it's a well built app
6548,"This is a very helpful for all of refugees students. I am Rohingya refugee from Bangladesh. I have got five certificates from this app. If wanna learn more and more, you will find free or with payment courses."
6549,üòçüòçüòç
6550,"Cousera has been instrumental in changing my perceptions about an online class. It is just as engaging as a real class room environment. The course models are flexible and the forums give you an opportunity to share knowledge and engage other course mates. In addition, you can apply for some courses for free.. Great learning tool."
6551,Excelent!
6552,Quite good
6553,Fraud app because he says it is free online course platform but every course are paid
6554,"I like the app. The courses are very informative, however, it would be awesome if I could save courses that I would like to take in the future or courses I might be interested in taking after I get doing with the course I'm currently taking."
6555,Brilliant!!!!!!!
6556,Nice

6567,This app is changing lives of many people. Infinite thanks are not enough for this initiative
6568,Very good online course
6569,"This app really missing some features like being able to hightlight / make a note in the lesson and being able to rotate the screen in any direction, you are locked to watching a full screen video ONE WAY! The quiz and test screen could be better, they're trying to be facncy but it's TERRIBLE! Keep it simple, all the questions in ONE page!"
6570,Excellent
6571,"I installed this app more than 3 times , every time when I try to open ,it closes immediately.."
6572,Ok
6573,"Took a class , wide selection of classes."
6574,"I was getting through my lessons fine,after a while i had to take an exam and multiple attempts with different help agents,they could not help me get through this one exam..after countless attempts of time after time wasted waiting for them to figure it out they could not.Now my subscription was cancelled and cannot continue my studies. Help agents could not figure out what was wrong and they just cancelled my subscription on me.This is how they practice their business!"
6575,Ill definitely give 5 star bcz they are giving us one of the asset(education) free with quality
6576,5 stars but how can I take note?
6577,Best learning platform ever. üëå.Most of the students in our university (University of Moratuwa) have done the Machine Learning Course already. It would be great if you consider to provide packages for universities to support youth. Anyway Great Work.

6600,Awesome
6601,Great app but really wish it had a note taking feature. like the desktop site.
6602,"Not able to open the application. Crashes as soon as it opens again and again. Tried clearing cache, uninstalling it everything."
6603,Great app study
6604,It wont stay open acc only opens again if I restart my phone or go through playstore Not worth the storage I'm uninstalling it.
6605,Cousera wouldn't rotate to landscape mode for reading lessons on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. And for video lessons some area on the left hand edge isn't visible on landscape mode. Please fix this!!

6617,Just a mess Really slow hangs out Alot it is fine on browser Coursera has the best courses online if you want to study study it on its own web page bcz this app will make you hate Coursera very slow loading of pages very poor downloading and hangs Alot this app is really slow and has a very bad user Experience

6633,Excelente
6634,I can't log into my account. And my connection is really good. But it keeps telling to check my connection. Please help me.
6635,Ai courses are classic
6636,I did not install on my cell phone yet it installed itself. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT INSTALLED??? I DID NOT LOOK FOR THIS APP & DO NOT WISH TO INSTALL.
6637,"The app is great , only a small problem , which is when i open a video in a course on the app and finish it, it doesn't update the website itself ( opening the video(s) on the mobile and finished the 8th week in a course and the change doesn't appear on the website )"
6638,The best professional education application
6639,unable to sign in or sign up
6640,Good app for online course
6641,"This app and the courses are fantastic. You can absolutely earn certificates, but it also allows you to audit courses for free. This is an amazing and invaluable app. As much as I would love to go back and finish college, I would never be able to afford it and I don't want a degree in anything that justifies the cost of college, so this app is perfect. Thank you so much to the app developers and the colleges and instructors who have their content up."
6642,"Coursera is one of the best platforms to learn many things. Unfortunately, this app is horrible. It crashes frequently and have to wait minutes to get into home screen. Using this app with a mobile data is a nightmare."

6650,Nice app for learning nd giving feature also in this app.
6651,good
6652,Downloads not accessible in the app.
6653,"The UI is great, but I experienced issues with the synchronisation of data. Progress made online on the main desktop browser did not reflect immediately (my last week did not update on the app until course completion). Offline use of videos in the app did not synchronise back to the online view of the app, therefore, I had to watch them again in online mode to log completion. Offline use is very important as one can work through content while in transit or out of range of internet connectivity."
6654,Best
6655,Why is there no option of keeping notes while watching the video which is available in desktop browser mode?? Developers should add this feature in coming update....
6656,"This is one of the best online learning platform. I have no words for it to describe it's importance. It provides wings to fly in this world. Anyone can learn anywhere, anytime, and anything from this platform with affordable prices. Thanks Coursera!!!!"

6661,"Generally android version is OK, except two things which are annoying. First one is, when you make the video to full size, it does not fit my screen and some part of thevideo(left side) does not show. Second one is, when you want to do the labs, it does not open the tools page. So everytime I have to use a browser to do the lab even in the same device."
6662,Great!!
6663,"It's a good app, but their is no course available for fundamental Physics"
6664,"If I press the home button, receive a call, or just switch to another app temporarily, it doesn't maintain the state of the video I was playing. Thus coming back, I have to find that video, start it from zero, and adjust the slider to where I left. This is very bad and unprofessional."
6665,Need to decrease prices

6687,One of the best educational apps in Playstore
6688,It is best
6689,Not able to sign in. Always showing an error of network issue....
6690,"This app is phenomenal. Who needs to pay to learn something when you can do it for free? If you do pay you're paying for a certification/degree. I love the app and I'm sure it will end up saving me time and money. One thing I wish you could add though is like a ""For Later"" playlist so I can keep track of courses without enrolling in them right away. Amazing app."
6691,I use to be able to access my courses and watch the videos on here but after the recent update I can no longer access my course. When I search my course it says I'm enrolled but I can't use it.
6692,Great application for learning
6693,One of the necessary apps that can be need for everyone.
6694,Start to learn all time.
6695,One of the most best learning app
6696,Ended up using it only for offline video. Hate that it doesn't fully support landscape mode. Every other week quizzes are not possible to do in the app.
6697,"It kept saying ""network error"""
6698,It is good learning platform.....
6699,The best thing that has happened to me
6700,This app really helps me improve my knowledge to another level.
6701,Great application‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
6702,Pay to use
6703,It gives me wings... I always want to study in top universities although somehow I failed to get admission in them. Butnow through coursera I can learn anything from top universities even in free...

6708,the coursera app is refussing to download itself now and iam still learning in coursera
6709,"I am obliged, thank you team coursera"
6710,No changelog for the past 50 updates. Just performance improvements and bug fixes. What bugs did you fix? What improvements did you make to performance? Hopefully the courses aren't as lazy.
6711,Thanks for giving the good chance..
6712,"One of the worst apps I ever used. Offline mode, especially sychronization, is broken."
6713,Great app. Course structure well designed. Include dark theme.
6714,A screen rotation option needs to be added
6715,"Great app. I love the idea of easy access to education for everyone. I would really like to see a feature in the app that allows you to ""Favorite"" and ""Save for later"" courses."
6716,App needs UI update. The interface is off on the s10e.
6717,Excelent app and content
6718,"Love this app, it would be nice if you could disable subtitles while casting to screen since it sometimes interfere with the lecture material"
6719,üå∏üå∏üå∏
6720,The app is just perfect as it is. Please do no change anything.
6721,It is fun
6722,"I just installed this application and I just can't login to my account. When ever I try, it shows network problems however, every other app on my phone is working well"
6723,Love it
6724,Is educative
6725,Excellent app to learn many things about everything
6726,App Works so smoothly and High Quality Courses on Coursera.
6727,One of the best app for Computer Science students. Unlimited number of courses are available on various topics.
6728,Great study
6729,Won't let me login rip
6730,Excellent App for Learning.. I have Learnt Alot... It boosts my thinking.... A thousand thanks for providing this awesome brilliant wonderful fantastic App.... Coursera!!!!!!!!!!
6731,This app sucks to just like Alison learning!
6732,Awesome
6733,"Overall of the apps is good, keep it up, hope tge developper can add alternative payment for the people who not use credit card"
6734,Wonderful experience. I really hope the app will be auto-rotate sensitive in the next update.
6735,It keeps saying I have an account with my email address but will not let change password.
6736,Please fix both side screen rotation bug during video lectures
6737,"bug: when i watch a video and switch to other app and then switch back to coursera, the video is only playing in the background and i am not able to see the entire video panel anymore. also it does not support downloading pdf slides attached with the video."
6738,Love this app
6739,Thanks. Nice place to learn new courses.
6740,Good
6741,Worst app and portal I have never seen the worst than that of it
6742,Coursera is best of all MOOC platforms. It provides high quality study materials from top universities along with flexibility to learn at own pace.
6743,üëçü§ô
6744,"Awesome but one bad flaw The app is great except fpr one pet peeve: on a finicky network connection it takes forever to resume a cpurse despite the videos already downloaded. What's worse, the app freezes, preventing the user from switching to the offline mode. Consider auto-switching to offline mode if it takes e.g. more than 10 seconds to perform any network operation."
6745,Very helpful app.
6746,Excellent
6747,"This is a very nice app, but sometimes it doesn't register (mark) that a video lesson was completed, although I think this is only in offline mode. Sometimes when watching a video, pausing it, and switching between apps, the position time is lost when bringing it back to the foreground. I would also like to ask for a popup asking whether you would like to resume video from the last timestamp, if the video has been viewed for more than a minute."
6748,There was bug in applications. There when I was try to give specilization course quiz at that time all my ans show me wrong. work on it. XML can't load data in application so pls improve that bug and give update assa so user can easily improve them self.
6749,Just love it
6750,Very good YB
6751,Great App to learn.
6752,Changes my attitude towards everything
6753,Free education for everyone What a Joke!!! your reason for blocking Iranian users are not acceptable
6754,Buggy and lots of friction on sign-in
6755,Awesome
6756,Pynlp ; sopplogyplmk gvlpp.pl college f min hope o ok
6757,"App won't open at all, it crashes every time I try to open it."
6758,Good
6759,Poor experience on tablet as does not autorotate content if in landscape mode. Also course content video should continue in full screen mode if the previous one had been in that mode to avoid having to keeping changing mode even when it spins up next content. Happy to be beta tester on app.
6760,Awesome App üòç
6761,Just thank you.
6762,üëç
6763,The current update has become better because of its simplicity.But in the future I hope the developer to make it easy in the download section too.
6764,Yet to to take course but seems to be amazing.
6765,V.good app
6766,Gran variedad de cursos.
6767,Great
6768,Closes the video every time I switch to another app
6769,Love this app. I can learn so much now.
6770,This app is very useful. Thank you
6771,Best ever
6772,Can't run on an older device. Not very happy atm. :c
6773,I love to lern MOOCs by using coursera. It is a wonderfull plateform for online learning enthusiasts.
6774,Prices of the course are a bit heavy!
6775,Great
6776,It would seem that this app doesnt remember your progress...
6777,Nice
6778,"Content videos are good, but still not economical. It is better to buy some good books, than spending money here. They don't offer flexible or unlimited packages. Some courses are open only after payment. This may be suitable for full time trainees and students."
6779,I am enjoying stretching my old mind in learning something new.
6780,It was good for learning Wt diff ideas
6781,Play in the background. great for note taking and multitasking
6782,Good app
6783,Everything else is good except that the progress in the app and web is not synchronized!
6784,Great
6785,I think Udemy is better than this . Courses in Coursera are so expensive and we cannot learn at our own pace which is the biggest disadvantage
6786,This app gives me more than what expected
6787,Don't know that others are fussing about. Don't rate an app one star because of something trivial. It's ridiculous. So far this app if sweeeet!!
6788,Wonderful
6789,"Lesson presentation formt is quite good, at least for the courses I have joined, but app hang often when using back button or when closing the app."
6790,Good
6791,Cancellation and un-enrollment issues on the site and application. Given help email is not working. And the review has been deleted for the 3rd time instead of acknowledging the issues.
6792,Great
6793,Best experience of learning programming.
6794,Exceptional resources for everything
6795,It's excellent
6796,"App is build solid, the offered material is extremely good as well. Unfortunately it is not possible to finish classes ""in your own time"" as advertised. During my specialization class, i had to wait constantly because material was blocked. Now i have to wait 3 months (paying of course) to start my final project! Be aware when you plan something that contains more than one class! It might take way longer and be way more expensive than you think. You might want to change to a more honest supplier!"
6797,Love this app... Easy to use... Useful..
6798,awesome
6799,Love Coursera! For someone who wants to learn but can't afford going back to school this is amazing!
6800,Good stuff
6801,Thank you so much
6802,Accomplishments are incomplete on the App. They don't show all my accomplishments.
6803,Very good info
6804,Extremely good
6805,"Best ever Online learning experience on coursera. But compartively edX have more features than Coursera. edX have courses from worlds top universities like Harvard, Columbia and MIT etc but Coursera only have courses of Stanford etc. Hope More improvements in future."
6806,Awsome way of education
6807,Good
6808,Courses are not up to date

6813,Wow
6814,The app doesn't let you to sign with your Organization.. I can log to my organization account browser but I cannot do so in the app
6815,The downloading feature was very buggy. The bug was fixed by the next update as soon as I reported it through app with the log files. The developers are keenly resolving issues. Great work!
6816,Incredible...
6817,They are not transparent with their payment policies.
6818,Life changing(In a good way) !
6819,This app can't let me login

6824,Excellent work
6825,Good
6826,Could never upload an assignment from the app
6827,bad design on long screen phones
6828,"Number 1 the search kept on stalling out clearing my search while typing numerously which was a pain. Found only 1 course i was interested in & didn't say if it would be translated from Russian, took myself off the course after that cause i think it would be extremely difficult as this is photoshop cc. All i wanted was to learn where things were in cc since everything is different from cs4."
6829,Really good üëç
6830,"Excellent app, for excellent education service. üëç"
6831,It's just the best
6832,Nice courses
6833,Nice app
6834,Used to have the app but not anymore. I'm using the website now it seems to have more information. But I'm having a problem playing audio on the website for tests. Is anyone having this problem with the app?
6835,Can't download videos for offline use
6836,Missing some features
6837,Really a Nice App for students and learners.Great Job Coursera Team !!!!
6838,Not able to download the app
6839,"Worst App When I started my course, after 20 minutes watching. Audio Automatically starts puase/beeping which took me 20 minutes to complete 7 minutes video Worst Quality Assurance"
6840,"App crashes, i cant log in. Also the website is the same. Can you tell us what is happening. Nothing is work, plz explain"
6841,i love coursera but why i download your app they said that its not work on my phone
6842,Add share button in course menu
6843,Very useful. This is for learners.
6844,Good
6845,Awesome
6846,I am loging through my organization credentials on app but it is opening on the browser not the app. The login page is opening on the browser and when i go back to app its asking me for credentials.
6847,"It's true that Coursera is the best online platform. however, the app keeps on crashing, and it's really frustrating when one uses it on the phone."
6848,"Really it's the best app in the world its better than gold. thanks god üôè because there are a good people's made this app. It's easy ,rich , enough,professional and a lot of variety. also I need to thank the guy who shared his app experience with me in YouTube. (I don't know the guy name but his channel name is technawy) I'm happy to found this app."
6849,"I like it, too much usefull app but 1 issue i found is that i can't access my courses notes on mobile version! Why?"
6850,I'm unable to sync to my calendar
6851,"After last update, my courses progress are never updated and now it is hard to keep using and acessing active courses."
6852,Excellent learning application with courses from the top institutes which let's you help in developing you're career...
6853,Not free
6854,Good one for those who long for life long learning
6855,"It's true that Coursera is the best online platform; however, my review includes only the application. sometimes it lags, and most significantly it requires you to open your computer because there are some functions that may not work smoothly on the phone. I hope that you make your app as independent and fully dependable as possible."

6857,Used it for class on my iPad and one final exam!
6858,Great app for online courses.
6859,"Coursera is the worst app, bloody cheaters!üò†üò† I have done certificate course from it. It did not provide me certificate for my course (When I enrolled, they said enroll for free and get a certificate at the end). As the course completed, they sent me a congratulations mail but no certificate. How can they cheat those who are its main income source? You have wasted my 14 weeks. Without any certificate it will be useless. Please don't cheat with your customers or soon your site will be closed."
6860,Will no longer even open. Tutors email me asking why I am behind and I've sent in a ton of reports. Still nothing done. I used to love this app. Very sad.
6861,Very effective for learner. It provides almost every topic to study with great course videos..
6862,Geeat
6863,Awsome
6864,Thos apk is a most excellent APK. I never have any downtime crashes I never lost any data. it's streamline its linear and very functional as far as time efficiency. I highly recommend this app.
6865,I have been taking some courses at Coursera and they all are very interesting.
6866,It's a shame that because of restrictions and sanctions some people in some parts of the world can't get education. Its hilarious that you offer education to others and then you block them from it. Damn it
6867,Good one
6868,Hi I'm from graphic era ...i think this gonna be awesome as i heard from my seniors
6869,"Very good extension for the website. It allows access to my courses when away from a computer. Most importantly, it works well on slow internet connections, and the offline mode is very helpful. I find the interface very simple and easy to use."
6870,"Freezes on downloads, cant cancel download, cant download offline content. Isn't it the purpose of mobile app? Plenty of 1 Star reviews, Google showing just one and all reviews good."
6871,"Recommendation: If one has finished a course, it should be marked as completed and not enrolled. Also, would love a search option in My Courses and Achievements."
6872,Teacher
6873,"Your courses, even those you are only auditing, available offline, and can save them on external storage. What's not to like?"
6874,What's wrong? I can't sign up.
6875,Love this app I canlearning at my own pace in a way that suits me and it keeps my brain active.
6876,‚ù§
6877,App doesn't continuously play and stops after a while. Had to turn on the screen and resume three times before deciding to listen to music instead. And they wonder why people don't finish courses.
6878,Not bad at all
6879,"Generally the app is good, But the Download function is lacking resuming capability. Pls fix"
6880,Thanks for creating this opportunity for us to Learn anywhere anytime
6881,"Awesome app, great teachers and programs"
6882,Data not available offline
6883,no. 1 app for online learning. loved it..
6884,simply perfect!
6885,good
6886,The application should have an option to bookmark courses one's interested in.
6887,"Coursera has come a long way from what it used to be, from the time when I would say psss to most of the courses to finding courses taught by creditable sources. I gotta give this org a 5 star for its app."
6888,good
6889,"I love the app but the only and the biggest problem is that ""can't pay without having a credit card"" I've tried several time to pay the fee using my debit card but there is only one option to pay and i.e credit card. I wish there would any option to pay through internet banking or debit card."
6890,"They pretend to be not for profit organisation with free courses in the beginning. But as soon as they got many users, they are trying to sell everything. Not happy with this cheap and unethical approach to marketing"
6891,Recurring Payment Issue Immediate Uninstall
6892,I love this app!!! I just hate the fact that you now have to pqy for the more ueeful features of the app...
6893,Superb app for learning.
6894,Great learning app!
6895,They charge your card automatically without confirmation.
6896,nice
6897,"I can't go further than the introduction video the course! I keep getting a warning that my computer's timezone setting doesn't match my Coursera account's time setting of LA, USA. But even after I change the latter to match the former, I still get a warning that they don't match. There has to be a problem!"
6898,"i am giving one star jus because i want to get heard,please add 1.75 speed of playing video, because speed 2 is too fast in some instances.."
6899,great variaety
6900,pretty nyc
6901,"Unable to sign in. It keeps says network error even though at the same time, I am able to sign in through web browser"
6902,It's very educative
6903,slow
6904,A+
6905,Constant battery drain warnings. UI is a bit lumpy but still better than the truly appalling mobile site.
6906,the best
6907,I would like it more and give 5 stars if I could see peer reviews through the app. Otherwise great!
6908,Offline feature saves the day. Search could use some cache for history. Nice UI.
6909,Tremenda App. La recomiendo 100%
6910,"this ui is bad , header like stuffs pls enable dark mode and data saver"
6911,I'm unable to click submit on most of my work. The app laggs and crashes makimg it difficult to proceed from one module to another.
6912,Download doesn't work properly
6913,could be better
6914,"the content, the way of dealing of multiple courses in terms of offline work is great"
6915,cool
6916,"I've Enrolled myself in IE business School course- ""Positioning: What you need for a successful Marketing Strategy"" in the First module Introduction to Positioning, video 1.1 the audio is not audible also the subtitles are coming up with (inaudible)....that makes my learning experience very bad.... I've to struggle alot so as to understand the concept....I was planning to purchase the course for certificate and full access but In the very beginning I face such a bad experience that now I'm not."
6917,Coursera is the future of best quality education. Best professors and high quality website along with great user interface make cousera the great platform to learn anywhere anytime. Android app of Coursera is not at par as website but still good enough to serve the purpose of portable learning. If you want to learn something then just give it a try. Well done Coursera.
6918,Great platforms. Awesome app
6919,"while watching a videolecture, there is no opportunity to turn over the picture, which sometimes would be very useful"
6920,app is much better than web browser it is also very intuitive and kind of encourages you to learn and keeps you engaged in the course
6921,not good
6922,Amazing app to learn things in more academic way.
6923,good
6924,too good. get it
6925,"good application, simple and understandable design, number of courses with fair price; but some of the cources hasn't mentioned University name."
6926,1 star. 5 minutes of clicking around the website trying to find pricing. What are you trying to hide Coursera? Frustrating. I give up.
6927,it's really good
6928,nice
6929,Really greatful app
6930,Excelente plataforma de estudio.
6931,"i cant upload file for assignment and when I finish assignment, it dosent mark as marked I can't complete my work"
6932,"really poor performance. some times videos not loading, other times already enrolled course doesn't appear"
6933,great
6934,good app
6935,all of the sudden Mobile app does not load quiz now.
6936,"when the vedio is playing as well as text is passing by , there must be Find Text option in app , as well as allow Copy text ."
6937,"not optimized for the large screen on the S10+, surprisingly, as this is the most popular android phone right now"
6938,excellent
6939,sometimes the video player will cover the description...
6940,I have a problem with syncing to calendar. The request to sync with Google appears to timeout.
6941,Estoy muy satisfecha de los cursos recibidos .
6942,excellent for learn something new
6943,good app
6944,slow
6945,Thanks for this awesome Application. You are so kind to make various courses available and accessible.
6946,"This app has worst tutors, this app has no simpler UI. Any begginer can get stuck in your UI. Worst course app, I will suggest to download and install Edx"
6947,best wishes
6948,Pretty blown away by this app. It's almost too good to be true...there has to be a catch.
6949,Nice experience....
6950,it would be great if you put an application for PC as well.
6951,GREAT COURSES
6952,it is one of the wonderful apps over wch one can study easily at home.
6953,Good
6954,it doesn't work
6955,Just downloaded it and the app has been non-functional since. It's garbage.
6956,A lovely app
6957,nice
6958,"It's great, but need since fixes"
6959,"I started a course, the video player is looping video and sometimes not playing properly. cannot go through a course video."
6960,Best ever for anyone. What's better than this?
6961,please add filters ...
6962,i am happy with this app but I think thier is less opportunity for mechanical engineer and for any queries how can I write a mail to you please tell me
6963,its awesome
6964,"The app is phenomenal BUT! I really wish it had like a wishlist option. It's not possible to enroll into all the courses one likes in a single go. Thus, a wishlist where we can keep track of the courses we want to enroll into once we've completed our current ones will be really helpful! It'll allow us to complete a streamlined set of courses without getting deviated too much (Because c'mon! there are just too many interesting things to learn here!)"
6965,very good
6966,It's amazing
6967,‚ù§Ô∏è thanx for moocs
6968,"very bad 1st experience. whenever I tried to logup, it shows no Internet connection"
6969,"Great courses for studying dont delete course videos as it causes memory loss for profs, i made 509 hours electronics lessons and am improving it"
6970,"Great courses catalogue. I recently completed a course in Genomic and Precision Medicine, something thats not offered any more on the platform. Thus, I couldnt apply for a financial aid. This is something not acceptable because the course was pulled off in between and though i could attend the lectures, i couldnt go for a financial aid. However, the option for a paid certificate is still available. Its a good platform and hence this was not expected."
6971,"I downloaded videos to watch offline. Unfortunately, when I logged in again after few minutes, I couldn't find downloads anymore. Useless app, defeats the purpose."
6972,Great
6973,By far Coursera is one of the most useful educational app in offer. Thank you.

6976,thank you for giving me financial aid
6977,while downloading study material for offline usage it says waiting for wifi/coneection even when theres an wifi coneection
6978,Cannot see how to change my profile information from the app.
6979,Excellent app
6980,make an desktop application as well because my phones hangs a lot and i can't store much information ....i have issue regarding the name ...as my name is short so i am forced to sign in with facebook .... I want a degree with the name p.manish
6981,awesome
6982,good
6983,Its tremendously awesome to learn and explore more about technology.
6984,Good app for learning...
6985,awesome app!
6986,very user friendly
6987,good
6988,Really good app! The only missing thing is an adaptive icon so it looks nice in my desktop
6989,awesome
6990,Excel Courses?
6991,good app
6992,tomaparvin5672
6993,very good app
6994,this app lacks a lot of features. Course information page is not supported from the specialisations info page unless we are enrolled in it and add an option for feedback within the app
6995,very good application if you want to improve your level of speaking and writing french
6996,Totally useless! I can't download courses through my data .This asks for wifi connection all the time
6997,I've been trying to use the app for days now but it keeps stopping and it's frustrating because it's stopping me from carrying on with the course i'm currently doing.
6998,wonderful
6999,nice
7000,cool
7001,waiting 15 min now for this thing to let me in. I had 20 min spar to read a couple of the reference articles. have just wasted 20 trying to get into my account. Just let me in please.
7002,Coursera brings the best courses available worldwide from the famous Universities at your feet.
7003,"Cousrera mobile app is good and can easily navigate through courses and stuffs.But the calendar sync and the custom course remainder(alarm) are not at all working,not even once. Please fix that as soon as possible."
7004,"Just a suggestion, I'd recommend creating a favorite/bookmarks button or folder for saving courses one is interested in but not ready to enroll in the interim. For example I had to 'enroll' in certain courses even though I'm just trying to save them for a later period."
7005,Good application to study
7006,"This app isn't working as it should. It is pretty good for watching video lessons, and that's all. The app doesn't remember or tend to forget your progress. When you try to do peers evaluating, it asks for comments and doesn't see them, insisting there is no text no matter how long my comments are. And it shows that I failed to pass modules because I had not submitted my assignments, though in desktop version everything is ok."
7007,"Does not work. There are only two options after I log in: to sign up/create an account, and log in/out (I show as logged in with FB). No option to browse the courses, access profile, anything. Just to log out&log in with email. Also, crashes after logging.This is extremely weird. I have used Coursera years ago on computer, wanted to start this habit again... But the app simply doesn't work. I tried logging in and opening it several times. Even deleted and reinstalled the ap. Nothing has changed."
7008,laggy and unable to download a course . it stuck at start download and stays whatever I do. clear data reinstall from scratch nothing makes it works. galaxy tabs3
7009,this course amazing one
7010,download function need some improvements
7011,"While Coursera as a platform itself is good, the app sucks. Half of my finished courses don't show up in achievements, same with the ongoing courses I'm enrolled in. Always a pain to use the app"
7012,"coursera is one of my fav website for learning but its android app is not working on my smartphone. whenever i download the app and opens it, then it always shows network error, even if my internet is working properly. please fix this issue"
7013,"Fantastica, s√∫per recomendable! Mi app favorita para aprender diversos temas üòÅ"
7014,hard to connect or take classes
7015,useless app can't even remember where i left the video. it's starting all over
7016,good app
7017,good.
7018,very good
7019,Terrific app; love it!!!
7020,excellent
7021,"I can not move away the hint (In a video ,you can double-tap on the side..)when I play the video,"
7022,nice
7023,Wont even login.... looking for other apps
7024,Coursera helps a lot
7025,Best one out there in the market
7026,"Would give more stars if the support email listed was actually active. I normally contact an apo developer if something goes wrong. In this case, courses I've completed on desktop are not being marked as completed on the app. I messaged the developers, but the email immediately got sent back to me because the address didn't exist and was undeliverable. If the app doesn't have accurate information and nobody is available to fix it, it only gets 1 star."
7027,the app start crash whem I open it after 5 second
7028,excellent! :)
7029,nice
7030,excellent
7031,Needs more video controls
7032,Free knowledge. I can't ask for more.
7033,"The app is not usable without a network connection, or with poor WiFi, even though i have already downloaded on content to use offline. The app becomes very unresponsive, slow in loading and when trying to start a downloaded video, and more often than not crashes. it's great when I've a good connection, but when I'm on my morning commute I want to use the app but end up more frustrated because of how the app behaves without wifi."
7034,terrible. cant access course feedback.
7035,"The app does not save your quiz answers (before submitting) , if you answered few questions and want to continue later you have to start again from scratch. Plus it has connection problems, I faced this issue few times where I answered all the questions in the quiz, hit submit to see that most of the questions that I answered were marked unsolved."
7036,good
7037,you can study here that is good the content is also fine but this application sucks üòë
7038,great for learning at your own pace
7039,it seems you cant save notes on the videos as with the regular desktop version. therefore it is useless to me as i rely on these notes for study.
7040,awesome
7041,Amazing
7042,i love the app very useful but recently it isn't available for my country (Iran) I didn't think understanding is a part of sanction

7044,The app is indeed very good but one major problem in this app is that the course mates don't take the review to peers assignment seriously They do not review it correctly and many of my assignments is left unchecked....due to which I lost my interest

7050,this is no. one
7051,The video stop running after few minutes...
7052,the app is really good for learning many things but I have a problem viewing the videos on my smart TV. how can I fix that?
7053,"I love this application very much. One problem is when using android tablets, ""this app may not be optimized for your device!""... but it works... The other problem is that when opening the app in landscape mode, it doesn't display nicely, it displays horizontally... which is annoying, but once in the course, it display in landscape mode.... could this be repaired?  This app should be designed to be shown in tablets (horizontally) and not only vertical."
7054,good app buy when you're taking some courses they talk of podcasts being part of the lesson but the podcasts are nowhere to be found
7055,Loved all the courses I have done through Coursera. Would not hesitate to recommend it.
7056,nice app!!!! very useful educational tool
7057,"I love the courses, but not the app, since using the courses I've downloaded is almost impossible when I'm offline!"
7058,Dueufhotsjo
7059,Reducing my original rating. Great platform but app is really bad. Content watched offline and quizzes taken won't sync properly once you're back online. And even offline contents won't load properly. Had to manually go to airplane mode to get it working.
7060,Great app for learning covering a vast amount of topics. I am very satisfied until recently when one of my classes did not show in my account. I tried to contact someone at coursera to get a quick solution. However coursera tries everything to keep you away from contacting them. The website leads you from FAQ to FAQ. It took me a nerve wrecking amount of time to finally find a small chat button hidden after various FAQs. For the price I pay there should be at least some call center. Poor service
7061,üëå
7062,awesome.. i am on a self and continuing education path
7063,"Tried playing the video for a lot of times for days already but same message popped up ""something went wrong while playing this video blablabla"". If you can fix this, I'll give this app 5 stars. I just wanna learn lol."
7064,best app for those who wanna learn
7065,"basically, almost all college/universityknowledge you could find it here, and its alllll free"
7066,"I can't log into my account! It always tells me ""network error"" inspite of perfect connection."
7067,good one and stable
7068,so good
7069,Coursera apps are a very useful apps to improved your programming skills easily I loved it.
7070,Excellent

7072,really awesome contents for Learners
7073,"Please, Please, Please put out some update to fix this bug, my coursera app keeps crashing on my Samsung S9. Other than that, I love Coursera. Gbam."
7074,The app is amazing and each course is different. I like how it's separated into short lessons followed by quiz or pop up questions throughout lectures.

7079,Excellent app. I learned a lot from the courses
7080,Very good Educational app for all. Thanks COURSERA
7081,Nice app
7082,The coursera app made it easy to access the course from any where. I finished many modules while travelling. The app interface is great as well. Thanks Coursera !
7083,"love the app, but i've been constantly getting ""error occurred while accessing quiz"" when trying to submit my quiz answers. (currently enrolled to only one course - not sure if error's present in other courses!)"
7084,cannot play video lessons and is therefore useless!
7085,"It is a great way to learn no matter what age group you are in! one suggestion I have, though, is having a save for later feature. Other than that, I'm happy with the app!"
7086,"At first I thought this app is promising, and got myself enrolled in one of the courses (Business English : Networking) There is 1 video for the proficiency test that just kept loading no matter what, and only played the first 5 secs. they have download option available. tried that but nothing happened. I cant finish the video! hence I cant work on my proficiency test and cant continue the course :("

7088,good
7089,some of the videos don't run.
7090,Great apk for learning any subject and earn a certificate. But they have a lot price.You can also try out for financial aid if you do willing to earn certificate.
7091,it would be nice to know what the prices are before enrolling. It makes it difficult to know if you can afford to do a course without initial costs
7092,very very helpful for me!

7115,Downloaded lectures are suddenly not accessible even when accessed online.
7116,Lots of courses to upgrade yourself.
7117,Does not sync to the latest progress point achieved via computer.
7118,I am doing a few courses like Grammar and Punctuation and Verb tenses. the course is better than what I expected with loads of interactive exercises and videos. Thank you for this wonderful app.
7119,best place to learn
7120,"While the app is free, and some of the courses are free, you need an account just to access it all... and accounts cost $40 USD every month. Very misleading."
7121,Most Beautiful app for educational as well as for Specialization purpose.
7122,amazing one
7123,Love the site. Sometimes the app isnt linked properly and it says I havent completed lessons that I have.
7124,"I can't enroll into any course from here, and at the same time I can't login on the website, because ""your device or network is sending automated queries"". This is just wasting the time I could have used to actually learn something."
7125,"I love the app but it has issues with syncing my offline progress with my online progress. So when I watch some videos offline and I go online, it tells me that I haven't watched the videos yet. Please fix this"
7126,keeps on telling me poor network everytime I try to log in..so frustrating
7127,I've always loved this app in the past but since redownloading it I can't even enroll in courses so it's kind of absolutely useless.
7128,"awesome, but would be better if we can download content as torrents too"
7129,This is an awesome app available on play store.
7130,cant download for some reason
7131,Very good 10/10
7132,coursera is a very good app for learners who wantto learn new things. it greatly helps me to learn and revise chemistry.

7145,Good
7146,"A very helpful and useful app, I recommend to use it"
7147,Pops up login page everytime I goto an assignment. So buggy. Even after I login thru the web frame (how seamless!) it doesnt stay logged in. Piece of webframe/cordova based junk heap.
7148,Love this app.
7149,till now i feel coursera is one of the efficient platform for doing online courses
7150,"this app is not working, I reinstalled it but still crashing."
7151,tried downloding 3 videos simultaneously and it crashed.
7152,"I really like using this app on my commute and will likely continue to do so but there are some basic functionalities that are damn annoying. the biggest issue is that when I'm watching downloaded lectures the app never updates the website. I have to search through videos to see where I left off. second issue is that if i don't have the screen on, the video will randomly pause."
7153,Can't browse without signing up. I want to see if it's worth signing up.
7154,love learning on the go or when im waiting at a doctors appointment. you can learn anything without the pressure. üëç
7155,I'm unable to access my account from my Android phone but on a computer I easily do. I need it to be accessible through my phone to facilitate studies at any time
7156,"Horrible refund policy.  My state requires a 30 day refund for payments, but I can't even contact them to raise the issue. Let it slip a day and they will not offer a refund, you can't even find a contact to ask.  It is impossible to find a contact for help on the site or in the app."
7157,Awesome

7159,Simply Fantastic
7160,best ed app.encompasses every other by miles.absolutely great
7161,it is almost useless because the videos always crash. I can be watching a lesson and it will crash at a certain point and if I go back to the same lesson it will crash again and again at the same spot. it already got me frustrated and irritated and dont want to use it anymore.
7162,Excellent
7163,Nice
7164,good
7165,"the ""sync to my calendar"" feature doesn't work, please fix it. whenever i toggle thr switch on it automatically toggles back of within a second and i have to set it manually on Google calendar for every assignment and quiz"

7168,am happy to join
7169,"Hello management, This application doesn't support all os its saying that we need to update os and i don't have that much of storage with my phone so please kindly help me out with this"
7170,Great App for learning
7171,Coursera: YOU NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM WITH INTERNET ACCESS BEING REQUIRED OFFLINE. OTHERWISE PEOPLE WILL DISOWN YOU AND GO TO YOUR COMPETITION.
7172,What an amazing app for lectures and more other courses! #lo_adoro
7173,I've been dying to go back to school but cabby afford it. Coursera lets me learn new things with the additional push of having deadlines to keep me on task and not give up.
7174,amazing
7175,nice app
7176,very good app and online learning platform. I am enjoying it very much
7177,"inept. fails to load, search & show. downloaded course not showing. frequently crashing without loading. Not working. wasting lot of time and data."
7178,"The app has stopped working in Android 4.4 Kitkat. My tablet can't be upgraded to a newer Android version. Also, it is not possible for me to purchase a new device every time for Apps to run."
7179,Good
7180,you try to withdraw amount 3380 rs from my credit card..without my consent...stop it Lkdham
7181,Love Coursera. But the app has a room for improvements. The simplest one is to make it save the current state of an activity. When i return to the app via a launcher after the pause of a video it displays the main screen with all my courses.
7182,I cannot reset my deadlines also my paid subscription is not show in subscription area.There is also a problem to apply for query from the app. I have applied for machine learning but due to this problems I cant send my assignments on time.
7183,thank u alot
7184,Good app
7185,This app gets log out automatically in every 4 to 5 minutes. Are there any setting anyone know about ?
7186,too good

I'm not sure, but its very strange. update: i went to the setting apps and checked there. Coursera is still on my phone. but it says install above"
7188,ex service
7189,Can't disable subtitles when casting. They are in the way of important information.
7190,"The course i took was easy to read and watch videos offline, but many of the tests required a PC for labs, making it difficult to progress. Often the completed lessons on mobile wouldn't sync with the desktop, so i had to rewatch videos to get credit."
7191,Latex rendering has to be improved.
7192,good
7193,"One of two courses I am registered not coming is my courses in app, even though payment is deducted"
7194,"It was advertised online as being free. I thought that was farfetched, but figured to check it out anyways. To make the account is of no cost. But mostly, each course costs 50 dollars. Not bad, could have been worse of a price."
7195,"Sometimes it logs out without a reason. Especially, when offline. That makes downloads unusable."
7196,"Can I tender the certificate in any Company in the UK, or North America??"
7197,money minded
7198,love to learn many things clearly
7199,Purchased a course and itsnot showing up anywhere and there is nobody to contact.
7200,app does nothing
7201,awesome
7202,I am not able to access some of the labs in my device that is a chromebook. The courses are qwiklabs and also some jupyter labs. Not sure why this is happening
7203,wonderful
7204,I like this app
7205,Great learning platform
7206,"It's amazing, this app"

7212,An amazing and user friendly app!!
7213,"Wow, the designers did a superb job on this UI! A year ago it wasn't as good. Great job designers!"
7214,"Useless when offline, as many others have described below. Please fix it."
7215,"very bad payment procedure, I subscribed for free trial. After one week without my notice and any information amount has been suddenly debited. Finally the worst thing is not even a proper channel to enquire about. I lost my amount."
7216,really helpfu
7217,Great app
7218,good
7219,noice thanks
7220,"I can't access video lectures and assignments anymore, it just shows me blank pages for each week and nothing loads. Please fix"

7222,good. I liked the way internationalisation issues were solved. best wishes pandit Pradeep Jagannath
7223,good app
7224,awsome
7225,keeps crashing and won't let me submit assignments
7226,Recently uninstalled. Is there any particularly reason this app needs permissions to pretty much my entire phone to work? Including sending email without my consent? Seriously...
7227,One of the best apps from the one of the best learning websites coursera. Everything is good except when playing a video if the video is set at a higher speed then there's a lag in the subtitles. Hope you'll fix it soon
7228,it keeps crashing a lot. many of the courses don't load at all. if I try to download then the app freezes. it has really good content so I'm a little dissapointed about its continuous crashing.
7229,best website for getting knowledge
7230,great app
7231,"Since last update, we are unable to view our grades for the courses we have enrolled."
7232,greatest app ever for learning thingsüòç
7233,exceptional app. helping me learn everyday at my own pace.
7234,Excellent
7235,This apps is very useful!
7236,"The grades tab on the android version of this application has disappeared after the last update. There's no way to keep track of individual assignment grades in consolidated form on the app, as in the browser version. Please put it back."
7237,bad app
7238,"rich, interesting, and professional in everything"
7239,Great place to learn
7240,"Sir I Am from India and  I want to Join IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

And there is no section of Pay with Debit card on the website. Please help me how will i do my payment,otherwise i am in a great trouble regardimg Academic."
7241,awesome
7242,Great app on the go + there is an option to audit the courses for free. Keep doing the good work.
7243,i like the stuffs in it.....
7244,Really helpful for higher education
7245,Not bad its good
7246,"Coursera is a great platform and it is a very useful resource for students to improve their knowledge and skills. However, the new update's theme is not so good. I liked the previous user interface."
7247,very educating and a great app
7248,awesome
7249,why do i have to log in now to use this offline? i have no data plan and cant access my offline material.
7250,great app absolutely loved the interface
7251,"Like the app! And the idea of on-line education. PROBLEM: every time I open the app it wants me to log in, so in case I do not have Internet, I am not able to watch downloaded videos. PROPOSAL: when I complete steps offline they are not marked completed on the platform when device (where I have completed steps) becomes online. But it would be nice."
7252,Good experience overall. It helped me to take online lectures for my registered course during daily commuting towards office.
7253,one of the best online learning platform which helps in building your career and as well your practical knowledge. if u have done certification then there are chances of getting placed in good mnc or start-up.
7254,there should be certificate courses for free.
7255,wonderful
7256,"Bad experience due to acidential logging out during watching downloaded content offline. And it asks to login, when you don't have a connection to the Internet"
7257,Really good app...works fine.
7258,It would be helpful if there was a way to bookmark notes the way you can on desktop.
7259,seems to stop (pause) a lot randomly during course videos. can't access autoplay options or turn off quizes. this reduces mobile usability also it doesn't remember where your are in a video. it defaults you back to the start.
7260,soso on smartphone
7261,Mast
7262,lovely lovely
7263,"The app seems to serve its overall purpose. Due to the app being developed for a mobile device, there is a perception that you are privileged to always have internet access. If that is the case what is the point of having a feature for you to download course material for usage OFFLINE when you are at a location with no internet access, and you can't log in. This was my motivation for the install, to use it during my 70 mins train commute. Please fix, it worked and now it doesn't, very annoying."
7264,good
7265,"Why on Earth would you disconnect users after 5min when they are trying to use your otherwise convenient offline mode?!? If I am using offline mode, by definition it means that I am unable to re-authenticate since I have no connection. Really sad."
7266,good
7267,"Awesome app to learn online courses specially google cloud associate engineer track. And I could not notice which video quality range(144p/360p/480p/720p) is playing, please highlight or add radio button in selected video quality option(Auto/Low/Medium/HD/)."
7268,Can't log out and switch accounts. Is there even a feature for it?
7269,"App randomly logs you out while watching downloaded courses offline, this makes app totally useless if you dont have internet access to login back again to continue watching your downloaded content."
7270,Asks to login when offline. Defeats the whole purpose of downloading videos to view offline. Fix this by allowing access to downloaded videos when offline instead of asking to login.
7271,great app
7272,"Xzz as Saxham a, x XX X AND U DAD G PHONON"
7273,"educative app, great contents but crashes oftentimes and doesnt work until I reboot my device."
7274,I really like the script under the video. Really easy to follow
7275,oranisation login does not work .it keeps signing in loader forever but does not sign in
7276,I love Andrew Ng Machine Learning course
7277,"this was a very good application that I used before, but unfortunately, now it is not working on my Android 4.4.2 platform. and also please make it available again to see how many reviews we got in peer review assignments before our grade is ready"
7278,Andrew ng‚ù§‚ù§
7279,Every time when I try to watch offline material and I finish the video the app asks me to log in. And since then I cannot watch offline things because I need a connection to proceed. The materials and courses are the best but I am someone that travels the most day and I don't always have wifi.
7280,"I have an account already (facebook log in, succeed), but failed to log in to the app. It said that I have no internet connection. Then, I sign up to register another account, and the app always want me to check for my internet connection, and said that I don't have an internet connection. Please reconsider this, thanks. Bravo Coursera."
7281,educating
7282,i got something nice from this app.
7283,This app is a very useful app and includ various fiela of learning video cours by the best university of the world
7284,learn alot of information
7285,badiya
7286,awesome app
7287,PDF version. How do I download PDF versions of the lectures or copy the lectures.
7288,Automatically logs you out when network disconnects
7289,awesome app
7290,"I like this app, it work very great. Thank you."
7291,best place to learn
7292,it logs out and can't view the content if I'm offline
7293,i really like it
7294,very good app
7295,Whats the point of downloading for offline mode if the app doesnt work if you're not logged in. Couldn't get pass the log in screen on my flight.
7296,Thank you coursera üåπüåπ üåπüåπ üåπ
7297,Thank you Coursera üåπüåπ üåπüåπ üåπ
7298,This app proves that downloading an app is free but education is not free. Well it's sad
7299,"very inconvenient. hard to have a general view of all courses one is taking. plus small but stupid glitches like the view is recentered on each screen touch and you have to scroll down again. update may 2019: after an update of the application, coursera app does not see previously downloaded courses. 2 gb silently buried. great job!"
7300,This is excellent platform to learn and explore the technology.
7301,nice app...
7302,was great but has started logging out whenever I go offline which has turned a once great experience a bit sour
7303,love it
7304,Wonderful
7305,"I love Coursesa app. You can even set a time schedule if you are busy in your work. I've learned something new that helps me to improve my skills. You can download it and learn if you are offline. I recommend it to my sister and friends who wants to learn but for now, I can't see my profile picture in the app. Please help me to fix this problem."
7306,perfect
7307,"Not sufficiently optimized app. i use this app on a tablet. displays videos in landscape mode, but tests in only portrait mode. cannot view certificates, pressing back button while doing test goes back without saving progress. needs a lot of work to be called tablet friendly."
7308,"In short: After 3+ years of usage, the app became useless for me. The reason is that the app requires internet connection every time the app is started. 3 stars for long journey with Coursera app. Long version: Used to be a big fan of the app. I used it watch videos offline when I don't have access to Internet, but now it's impossible. Every single time I start the app, I am asked to log in. Of course, log in requires Internet connection. No more use of offline videos."
7309,I appreciate your work. thank you.
7310,seamless
7311,"Coursera is perhaps the best platform for online learning, but this app is WORSE THAN RUBBISH. It frequently crashes my phone, making it completely frozen, and I'm forced to power cycle it to recover. The interface is not user-friendly on phones with small screens. Moreover, the app doesn't appear to work without a live network connection, which means you can't learn on the go. My daily commute is the only time I have during the day for watching lecture videos, but I can't do that with this app. I used to be a Coursera fanatic, but now I'm not able to take their classes on account of their app being totally unusable. Consequently, I rarely take Coursera classes now. It's a shame that such a great online platform for learning has been let down by such a poor app."
7312,so usefull
7313,number 1 for me.i learnt a lot of things here.
7314,this is tottaly awosome
7315,"It's my favorite site but app I can't download or install, please let me know the problem"

7317,love
7318,"Every time when i try to sign in it shows ""Sign in failed; Network error, plz check our Internet connection"" but my connection is always okay. what the hell is going on!!!!!"
7319,best app for those who genuinely wants to learn something.
7320,Nice
7321,Tonne times Thank You for creating this App‚ùóüòãüòä
7322,Really useful app
7323,it's Very Good Study Program üëç
7324,great place to learn new things
7325,"Needs Update. App not optimised for phones with Hole-punch displays, like Samsung galaxy s10. An additional black bar is added in the area of the camera-hole on top of the usual one(due to 16:9 video). This makes the video small and lays waste to the big displays phones have these days. Please update so that we don't face this problem when using Coursera on mobile."
7326,need more courses regarding livestock farming.
7327,i learn well with this app
7328,Excellent application to learn new things and polish your knowledge. The lectures and courses from recognised universities help you to gain the best of the experience in learning.
7329,nice
7330,The app is not loading any of the courses which I click on. I have to view courses and material on browser only. To me the app hasn't been of help yet.
7331,Very nice for learning purposes.
7332,Nice
7333,"Course progress is not synchronized between the website and the app. Tried clearing app cache and data, didn't work."
7334,great
7335,great app for learning by oneself
7336,Enjoyed it.
7337,I have taken seven courses already. Very learning tool indeed. It will help me to enhance my knowledge and skill.
7338,"Don't know about quality of teaching content it includes. Just downloaded and now will be uninstalling it as prices for basic courses are too high. And also, sorry but App is not that user friendly. I am happy with Udemy i was going to give try for coursera but seems it's out my paying capacity :/"
7339,This app has been a great experience for me and myself This has helped me a lot of things that I've never done before and I have been very helpful for it
7340,Remain awesome like this. Don't change.
7341,v. good

7350,"I live in America, where everyone does not have the same oppportunities for an adequate education. However, Coursera almost levels the playing field."
7351,I thanks
7352,"couldn't use it, every course i chose ""error retrieving the course"" a shame"
7353,sometimes lagging when showing video progress (which I watched and which no) after watching but courses are great!
7354,Can't sign up at all. It keeps telling me to check my connection but even after I changed my internet provider i still can't sign up. Clearly there is something wrong with this app.
7355,bad
7356,super
7357,"Coursera offline doesn't work properly. What's the point of offline mode if you first turn off Wi-Fi, access the app just to find out you can't even load into the app? That just renders everything pointless about offline mode."
7358,Not able to create account.
7359,Can't load my course
7360,helpfull
7361,A very useful app for studying because it's designed that one can study from cellphone as well.
7362,"The video player can not be controlled by Bluetooth buttons, for pausing, resuming, jumping 10 sec forward and backward, etc"
7363,Amazing
7364,Hi I can't seem to download the videos for offline viewing. The download symbol just goes on forever and ever. And ever. Galaxy S7 user.
7365,"Not Optimized The previous version worked well and I much preferred the layout. I seldom used my tablet but now I do and it is never quite clear why things work as they do. After years of fitting the Coursera typical demographic of a learner who had a degree and basically dabbled I wanted to finish two very different courses, before reaching a conclusion about future study. I had a strong start and now difficulties with the app are perhaps a newer world issue."
7366,"Apparently, this app is consuming a lot of battery. Also many PT-BR localized strings are duplicated."
7367,"I had enrolled for PYTHON FOR EVERYBODY course and already filled in my card details and paid the amount, yet it is not showing my course and neither my subscriptions"
7368,"It is a valid and authenticated learning app where renowned professors from noted universities take lectures with ample examples, assignements and tests. It is also good that we get a carry away certificate that can be attached to our career resume."
7369,I want to use my android mobile for my course but unfortunaly the video is affected drasttically by the overlays of the playback controls and the greyish overlay on the whole image. All this makes impossible to watch the video efficiently.  I would expect that these overlays vanished after few seconds of no interaction but instead they are shown permanently. I kindly request to solve this issue so that video experience is improved.  >> The contact email address of the developer does not exists.
7370,The foundation is superb and the app is supporting it even more #Andrew Ng's teaching is simply superb
7371,best learning app
7372,Great thanks... I have a lot yet to study

7390,"Good for learning on the go. But when I download lesson videos for offline viewing, my course summary does not update my progress since I watched the videos offline. would be great if students can update their progress after watching lessons offline"

7409,"With a busy schedule, this would work perfectly for me. However, none of the videos would download for offline use. Don't tell me my videos are ready and then they're not even downloaded. Do I have to pay to use that feature? My review will change once this little tidbit is resolved . . ."

7434,"For me the app doesn't work most of the time. Nonenof the course gets loaded; I cannot enroll from mobile. ultimately, cannot learn on the go unless I use it on my desktop."
7435,good
7436,one of the best in the business.
7437,amazing app
7438,Ok
7439,"I'm sorry to say that, but the current Android version (April 2019) of the Coursera App is a total trash:  1) the videos are permanently covered by the info banner about 10 sec scrolling. So, the app is just unusable.  2) in the horizontal regime the half of screen above the list of lectures within the week contains absolutely unnecessary info about the course title and number of the week. It would be much better to hide it after scrolling down. 4.5 inch screens are still in wide use in 2019!  3) the most stupid thing is the new list of courses! Seriously, one course per whole screen?! What for? Please try to use it with at least 10  courses in your list. It becomes unusable.  Again, sorry for emotions."
7440,It a fabulous app
7441,great learning app
7442,Amazing experience.. I felt using this application. Always it saved my money n time
7443,Everything is fine here except sync. If I use it to study and then switch to web app to continue and then again switch to mobile app it doesn't show me last lecture I studied on wep app as completed.

7464,one stop for knowledge
7465,"I completed a neuroscience course but now my certificate is gone. Also all of the courses I was enrolled in. I also notice I cant even enroll into anything. It constantly says loading. ***UPDATE*** I uninstalled and then installed again and logged in, everything is there ^_^"

7478,I'm enjoying the courses but it's really annoying that no matter how far I am into a course it always opens up in week 1.
7479,Great
7480,Since updating to Galaxy S10+ the video controls on the video do not go away.  I uninstalled and re-installed that seemed to help but a day later the video controls do not go away.   Unless I can't find a setting somewhere?  Also just spent 30 minutes trying to find a place for feedback or request help on the site and I can't find any.  Hopefully someone from coursera actually reads these.
7481,i find the things i learned here relevant
7482,excellent

7537,OK thanks
7538,"1. An app must not enforce the users for update. 2. Mobile app does not show the details of a submission. if the app is already installed, there is no chance to use the full website version at all because it again enforces the user to use the mobile app."
7539,excellent
7540,Very good courses
7541,"No Longer Works, says I'm offline when I'm not and won't let me see my courses. Very inconvenient when I have to travel frequently and can't lug my computer around everywhere."

7577,"Doesn't tell me the app won't work on my OS until after I install and launch it... how dumb. Just make it require Android 5.0+ to install, like any other app that needs a particular version!"
7578,its a very good app which is very useful and helpful
7579,"Used to be way better. Most courses can't even be completed on the mobile app, you have to use Firefox for some assignments and that has bugs too."

7615,"inside the app, the typing in the ""search catalog "" is buggy that i could not finish my search type before the searching kicked off, disabling the search experience"
7616,I downloaded the app then discovered a warning that it can make phone calls without my permission which may result in charges. I couldn't find a way to prevent that so I uninstalled it. Pity as I was looking forward to using it.

7639,"since i updated the app, I've been unable to submit my tests. please look into this."
7640,"Keeps hanging / loading when I try and open a quiz. Now I can't complete any quizzes, even though I am enrolled for a degree course."
7641,"Coursera has made a number of improvements over the past year and hopefully this will continue. Unfortunately, with the last update i was logged out of the app and there is no way to log in again. As a reault none of my courses are available and i am forced to use the web to participate in my active courses. For such a critical error to be released i am giving the app a low rating."
7642,"its a big oppurtunity giving in finger tips, every one can bw part of the learning field. it was amazing, i love u cousera."
7643,app wasn't even showing the courses i am enrolled. had to uninstall and install again to come back to normal.
7644,"The app overall is greatly appreciated but the enterprise experience has one significant annoyance. The app first completely loads in the private mode after which reloads again switching to the program page... making you wait twice as long to get started.

7660,"Confusing as hell, I enrolled in a specialization with 3 courses and after I finished the first course I cannot enroll for the second, getting Failed message..."
7661,The course helps students with less time to cope with full time classroom training. Flexibility is the key in this platform.

7663,very good interface
7664,"The app keeps crashing when trying to download videos offline....very irritating and takes the experience of carrying your course content with you anytime right out of the window. frankly the whole point for me to download the app was to view content offline and if thats not possible, there is no point really for me to have this app as i can view the content online on a bigger screen on the web. please look into the problem at the earliest. thanks."

7673,yes the best app in the woprld
7674,I'm taking a specialization course and it does not update that I've completed course components. Very dense and not personable help center that is not at all helpful. Very frustrating.
7675,"really appreciate it ,,,, worth of trying it ."
7676,"There is a bug in the app,When you minimize the app while watching the lecture and reopen the app again the video will not play."
7677,"With the latest update, it hasn't been able to function well as it used to do. While, enrolling/subscribing for the course with every new tab which gets openey up it shows error."
7678,best online learning app
7679,Great online learning experience adding real value to students through various set of valuable courses
7680,wonderful enhancing
7681,awesome application
7682,nice
7683,Its great but I wish it had a star button so I can star the courses I'm not ready to take yet
7684,always exit after one minute of playing video.Very inconvenient
7685,"Great app, but how do I turn off the subtitles when casting to my Chromecast? I tried tapping English because I thought it might be a toggle, but it isn't. And there's no option for none."
7686,Excellent
7687,"There seems to be a glitch with the app. It does not synchronize with the website. I completed my assignment and peer graded some assignments, yet it shows overdue on the app."
7688,why disabling android lower than version 5 !!!
7689,This company is a SCAM! I went to cancle my 7 day free trial and they already charged my card. There is no contact email or phone number to dispute this. 100% SCAM
7690,"Bug - always ask for closing app when I want to watch downloaded videos , it just kick out and can't use app any more. For me this 0 STAR !"

7699,good app
7700,Pathetic App
7701,$$$ so idk
7702,the way to use the app is easy
7703,The app has recently started to show many errors. Many courses I'm getting enrollment error and sometimes course is not loading. It was all good initially but not now.
7704,"This is a very nice app, that allows to do almost everything one needs to do in order to complete a Coursera course (with the exception of writing, submitting and peer grading peer-graded assignments). There are a few bugs though, that seem to be easy to fix, yet are infuriatingly annoying, because they pop their ugly heads every single time one opens the app. The first one is that once you open an app, it keeps refreshing a couple of times, and you can't do anything until it's done, because no matter what you do, it will bring you back to the main screen. The other one is that videos you've watched do not appear as completed until after you've reset and restarted the app. The third one is that progress within a video is not retained across app restarts. If you fix just these 3 issues, it's a 5-star app."
7705,wonderful experience
7706,great app!
7707,great app
7708,unable to download the app
7709,"Oh my goodness, it's a tremendous platform for those who wished to learn from abroad , one of dream comes true I got my economics certificate from pensylvaniya university.There is superb lectures and several interactive sessions and project works with the top quality we expect , thank you coursera for giving me such a glorious platform to learn Neuroeconomics"
7710,"Coursera is my favourite MOOC site. But the app is annoying, it doesn't have full functionality like the webpage so when I switch to chrome it redirects me every time to the app which doesn't have that feature. I have to uninstall and reinstall everytime."
7711,"Could be great, however privacy policy awful."
7712,"it doesn't even work, I think it's not suitable with my mobile but WHY IS IT ALLOWED TO BE INSTALLED IF IT DOESN'T SUIT?! when I log in it stops and give me a sign that the app unfortunately stopped"
7713,No good for me!
7714,great
7715,the app doesn't play on android4.4.2 kitkat
7716,Please further improve this app
7717,downloads getting stuck

7720,Amazing app for continuous learning....
7721,"This is the first interaction I've had with Coursera the mobile app. Nothing is loading, a number of course Ive looked at gives me a message that says ""error retreiving course"". Besides that, it takes way too long for the app to load. Coursera is a great source, and I would love to have it on my phone on the go."
7722,good
7723,Great
7724,unable to sign in with Organisation. it keeps showing loader.
7725,Wish I could use the note feature on the app
7726,"Used to be great- now just a money making machine!! There are plently of other free apps to learn. I used Courses for years, but never again. This used to be about helping people who were wanting to learn but couldn't afford to/able to learn elsewhere. Now it's just about a VERY costly profit machine."
7727,Good.
7728,Best
7729,Excellent. Thank you
7730,Great application and a 5 Star customer support.

7751,üòçüëç
7752,"Continents are awesome, but the App itself needs improvement. For example, the downloaded courses are not accessible due to the app stuck in the online content searching mode at start up. It needs to start with a WiFi or 4G connection before the offline contents can be viewed... please fix this bug and I'll fix my rating to the App."
7753,this is an amazing app. hope I will be able to make use of it heavily.
7754,App should save offline videos in external SD card but it saves in internal memory
7755,"good for education purpose and affordable for economic weak peoples for higher study,s and earn degree from best University"
7756,I can't describe what my feeling was but it was the best platform for education for me. Love you Coursera
7757,not able to view the youtube links on mobile app mentioned in video course strategic management by copahegan bussiness school.
7758,it is best online education
7759,awesome app
7760,Excellent App

7763,please fix lessons show in the courses by week. if i took 2 courses nothing appear

7769,Edit: thanks for fixing the issue.
7770,"there is a problem in the app. when i open an assignment, a suggestion tells me that i should do it on a bigger screen. then when i choose the try on this device option, an error occurs and i can't access the assignment. i don't have a laptop, so i need to do the assignment on the phone"
7771,useful
7772,worst application platform.
7773,I can't sign in. It keeps giving me a network error notification even though I am definitely on the Internet
7774,wonderful
7775,"Great app, but the UI overlap with the notch, hope it will be fixed soon."
7776,Not working. Network error with a good internet connection
7777,"RIP off, kept blocking me from finishing my class due to payment due but accepted my money for 4 months"
7778,Great app
7779,bugs bugs bugs
7780,Good and valuable app
7781,I downloaded this app on many different devices and none worked!! always get the message of i can't sign it because there is something wrong with my password or username though they are correct!!
7782,awesome app
7783,"a very useful application, I learned a lot of thing, keep going and develop it for better"
7784,There is one annoying problem. I downloaded videos to watch them offline but when I try to watch them a pop up is shown saying ooops something went wrong. I have to temporarily turn the Internet on and then off again. Only after that videos are played normally. But it is annoying
7785,There is an serious issue on downloading reeources for offline viewing!
7786,Thank you
7787,"I depended on this app to learn for free as I'm disabled, now that's no longer possible as every course has a fee."
7788,i loove soo much
7789,Cousera is a wonderful platform with a great app. i just wish they could add windows app to their app collections
7790,nice app to learn something new
7791,Nice content but it always fails to submit my answers in app so I have to log in on chrome to re-complete my assignments - which is just a waste of time
7792,"Great app, but there are a few issues with downloads. When we download, there is no clear option to stop download of a single video / reading. This is especially an issue when a download is waiting for network."
7793,loved it... however.. difficult to find the last lesson and resume your study.
7794,"Doesn't update or synchronise with my course on the PC, telling me I'm overdue for assignments that I've already submitted and received feedback on."
7795,"Extremely slow startup, and slow updates/loading of in-video quizzes while online. Also needs 10s skip option."
7796,"Coursera is an amazing platform for learners. People can literally learn so many different topics for free from here. And of course they can purchase a course to get peer review, do extra assignments and get a real certificate. Hats off to devs and mooc! Note for the devs: Faced two problems with the current app 1. The smartphone app wont synk with the web version, the progresses I've done with a browser will be shown as 'overdue' on the app. 2. Discussion forum is not as active as it should be."
7797,It is the best app and also the app of the education era at present
7798,The link provided to reset my password does not work.
7799,really clear and useful app
7800,superb
7801,This most recent update made it so the app no longer could play offline downloaded classes. The only time I can study is during my commute - so this effectively means I can no longer use Coursera :(
7802,great
7803,Very disappointing. I've canceled the subscription but it renewed it all by itself.
7804,only few courses
7805,Great App
7806,Very supportive app for many courses
7807,The best oneline learning platform with great courses from best institutions.. worth trying and learning...
7808,keeping track of all my courses is better than the web version. great job!
7809,if this app is not optimized for this device then why the download continues in play store??! :(
7810,I wish coursera would work on android kitkat....
7811,most learning software in China
7812,"The content on Coursera is phenomenal, as are the periodic projects and peer grading that use what I learn, and therefore deepen my learning. The app has some bugs. It freezes my phone sometimes. I can't upload pics/files from my phone when submitting projects. If you fix that, it would save me emailing them to myself, downloading on my computer, unzipping, and finally, uploading. It doesn't really let me do peer grading when on the go."
7813,not good in kit kat android vergin
7814,6 user trackers including 4 that are sending personal activity to Facebook. Stay away.
7815,Fantastic if translation available in other languages we select
7816,very useful app
7817,Thanks to Coursera Authority. Because of them I am learning many things for free of cost.
7818,Facing trouble in submitting quizzes. Can do the same via browser without any issues
7819,Great app. But it needs the 'Go back 10 secs' feature. Because many times I want to go back and relisten. The drag back function takes you back way too long

7892,it is good app for learning but is quite slow.
7893,A very good app in terms of interface and accessability
7894,"Following my course was made smooth sailing thanks to this app. Only problems that I had was that the Android version doesn't sync immediately if I were to continue the course on another device. It can get frustrating if you don't remember the last video you watched. Another is that the app doesn't keep track of how long you watched a video, only if you completed it or not. I can watch 14 minutes of a 20 minute video, quit, and then come back to have the timer start back at zero. I did love the video quality, though."

For example, the web version shows the ""Suggested Reading"" chapters correctly, but the Android and iOS versions don't; optional assignments aren't counted as unfinished work on web or iOS, but they do on the Android version; etc. Uninstalling, will come back in a few months to see if it's any better. UPDATE: a year later: all bugs fixed! Excellent app now, thanks."
7904,"its the best learning app so far, it has resolution adjustment goodjob"
7905,üòòüòòüòòüòò
7906,"I love the download offline option a lot. It allows me to watch videos and continue learning even when I am not online. But there is one little problem. When I try to download a week's content, it downloads all the videos including those which I have already watched when I was online."
7907,very good for larning education

7938,The app freezes right after using it for 10 seconds
7939,"Brilliant app. The automatic subtitles scroll also - > well done. Sometimes there are mistakes in the transcription though and there is not easy way to suggest a fix. Would also have been nice to have a landscape view of the video and a two liner of the scrolling text. Maybe in landscape, you could only need one line. Offline use is brilliant. Good job guys."

8024,"I'm trying to take a programming and any time there is a video, I'd like to be able to use my Chromecast. However, the videos usually have information in the bottom center of the video which is completely blocked by captions you cannot turn off, making Chromecast support for these videos entirely worthless."
8025,"Well, an accredited master degree opportunity, as advertised, is worth the chance at its investment cost, even if failure. I am unsure if one can get the experience thats needed in just an online level, but stand by for official review."

8153,"Some videos won't load, but this can be fixed by deleting all data. The download option for videos disappeared. Would like the option to change speed on videos. As is it seems difficult to complete a course using only the app, which is all I can use as my computer time is extremely limited."
8154,App will not allow me to log into be able to do my work on my phone. I'm stuck using my laptop and can't do the work when I'm out of the house. Which is all day.
8155,It's a nice app
8156,"It's not working, getting   ""Sign In Failed Network error, please check your internet connection""   while my internet connection is perfectly working."
8157,After the new update images are not visible...
8158,Great application for self learning
8159,Crashes too often. Even after downloading content it doesn't work well when offline. Disappointing.
8160,Beautiful learning method
8161,Courses are nicely structured and are easy to navigate. Even the content is very good
8162,Best learning app
8163,The courses are nice and well instructed. But i have complaints about the app navigation. Tests don't work even in high speed net. Also syncing with the web version takes time.
8164,It's a great app filled with helpful courses on various fields . It helped me to a great extent .
8165,Great app
8166,Nice
8167,Good..
8168,Wonderful
8169,Now almost all course are payed . They claim it was free.
8170,Draw you in with self paced learning but not all courses are available and canceling is a hassle. Eventually after contact their support multiple times I was forced to reverse the charges on my credit card. Even then they continued to try and charge for a subscription.
8171,Good helpful app in English courses
8172,"I hate this company! I started a free trial and made sure I cancelled it, I even received the message saying I'll have certain percent off if I stay. I still cancelled it. Days later I get an email saying my subscription has been renewed and they won't issue a refund. I know for a FACT, I cancelled my free trial. This place is a fraud!"
8173,Excellent app for short and long term courses. I did a course and got my e-certificate too.
8174,Please make fast-forward and rewind through two tabs on left and right side.
8175,excellent
8176,Its really great app it kept me studying on
8177,"Great idea. The mobile app is unreliable (keeps crashing/ doesn't load properly). The website is better though. The app stops responding sometimes and some other times, it loads pages on it's own"
8178,I cant sign in to the app For many days everytime i try to sign it says there is a problem with your connection ... there is no problrm with my network the problem maybe is with your backend work
8179,I can study at home and can get certificates from there.
8180,Good
8181,"I can't log in to my account. Theres a prompt that tells ""network error"" but our net is fine"
8182,"Everytime I want to login or sign up ,it always says no internet connection,when I actually do have internet connection. I can play TED ,browsing,but always can't connected in Coursera. It's a shame. I really love this app before,I wish you can fix it soon."
8183,Not letting me log in
8184,App keeps crashing my tablet. Seems from the other review that this is not an isolated thing.
8185,"Can't log in because of network connection error, despite my wifi is okay. Do something"

I've been using coursera for over two years now, taking many courses and Specializations. I added the achievements to my resume and LinkedIn, and was able to score a promotion. I strongly advise trying Coursera out."

I've signed up for a networking course and it's important for me to understand animations on how message gets transmitted and etc. If u could fix that it'd be nice"

8295,"With the new update, I have to login again and again, every time I go back 
to changing to the next or previous video of the course. This was not the 
case earlier. And it was a great app."
8296,"According to their support (which is laughable), there's issues with 
submitting assignments and performing peer reviews, and their staff is 
aware of this. Honestly, if there's issues and you're aware, but unwilling 
to resolve them, disable those ""features"" and simply have this app be for 
watching/reading the coursework and have the app itself direct us to the 
website to do the rest; I'm astounded that I needed to have a pointless 
chat because I got an error while attempting to submit a support ticket, 
all just to find out that they're aware of the issue, and without telling 
you directly, simply direct you to the website rather than address the 
issue. I Suppose you'll get what you pay for, seeing as how you get an 
abridged course from a higher education institution that you may otherwise 
not have been able to afford. The quality of the content varies wildly, 
even across tertiary classes of the same course from the same college, just 
presented by a different professor. (The subtitles on one actually said 
""[inaudible]"" in my first class!!) The faculty should really just write the 
content and let professional presenters deliver it, every class I took 
started with something to the effect of ""I'm used to being in a classroom 
so being in front of a camera is making me nervous, sorry."" Please take a 
page out of PBS-Digital's book and have presenters in front of the camera. 
It works for Craah Course and all of PBSD's other YouTube shows. TL;DR: 
Coursera is a great concept, but is being implemented... ok. Just ok. They 
could definitely do worse, but there's absolutely room for improvement."

8463,Such an amazing world of info!!!
8464,big surprise. better than expected
8465,Best app for students
8466,"Almost every course is paid now... Like even if I do not want a 
certificate. you still have to pay for even watching the lecture videos. 
What is the whole point then."
8467,"Please add Google payment portal including network carrier payments option 
please"
8468,Very good
8469,"It would be wonderful if students can have these lectures free but it's 
disappointing that you guys have build barrier of money between education 
and student who might not be able to afford these expensive courses"
8470,Not able to enroll in any course
8471,"I cannot access any of the course. I keep getting ""error"" messages anytime 
i try to enroll in courses material."
8472,"surprised that the downloaded videos are not available when there is no 
network connection. The app tries to open the course and gets stuck there"
8473,"Wow, great example of taking a working, usable app and messing it up 
completely. I can see courses for which I'm not enrolled in my courses, but 
not the ones for which I am enrolled. When I did manage to get to lectures 
I wanted to watch (fortunately I'm redoing a course, otherwise there's no 
way to get to the lectures), downloading a lecture results in the scroll 
position bouncing around so I keep having to scroll to the lectures I want 
to download."
8474,"Constantly seeing messages ""Error loading forums"" and ""There was an error 
loading the course content"" even with stable connection. Poor 
synchronization with the web app, works only with wi-fi. Videos ticked off 
as watched randomly turn back into unwatched the next session. If a course 
has text post with images, the app only downloads the text (even on wi-fi), 
so the images are missing when reading offline. Can't force the images to 
load through the mobile network, even with all the settings allowing mobile 
downloads."
8475,Tanks
8476,Clear and concise! Thanks!
8477,Great app. Very convenient to use
8478,I always prefer this one
8479,No support for android TV
8480,"Very useful app, but now all courses are paid. Plz tell me how to enroll 
for free course"
8481,"Font rendering is really poor, I can't use the app."
8482,What are the free courses available
8483,"constant failure to download videos, useless"
8484,i think the app is cool for learners on the go
8485,"I don't know about how many course i can do if i enroll for 1 month 
subsription. Please provide information about How many course i can do if i 
will subscribe for 1 month ?"
8486,Great idea
8487,It's very nice and productive app
8488,"One of the best era to learn any course with certificates. Teaching skills 
are good."
8489,"It's a great app, generally, except it keeps freezing my phone from time to 
time when used in offline mode, requiring me to take out and replace the 
battery of the phone. I updated to the latest version, and it's still 
happening. That's just frustrating, cos one could lose important stuff that 
one is working on because of this behavior. Then it's just frustrating on 
its own."
8490,Great
8491,This app doesn't even allow me to sign in ..
8492,"I can't subscribe any course as it always shows ""error loading enrollment 
data"""

later"

8510,"So far, so good."
8511,"The app is very good but I have a trouble. After the last update the app is 
set to ""use coursera offline"" by default and I am trying to disable this 
but it automatically return to the ""use coursera offline"" again, so Ican

have saved snd iwish that ican find a mark that i had watched the video 
after watching it in offline please do that"

8551,good
8552,"I am loving my course and learning a lot but there is one problem. My 
grades are not getting updated on the app. Even days after I had gotten my 
grades, the app still tells me otherwise. Please look into this issue but 
otherwise great app."

fun away. Startup is now very slow and depends heavily on Internet 
connection, otherwise some downloads can't be accessed. I also find it less 
usable than before, and support has never been able to solve my technical 
problems (they always tell to reinstall the app, which of course is not a 
solution if that app is bad in first place)."
8562,"New update is disgusting.... every time I open the app....it just stop 
working.... White screen... Or bug fixing issue .....app is good but the 
new update is worse"
8563,Nice user interface. Pretty good courses. Flexible schedule.

functionality of the website limiting how much of the coursework can be 
done from mobile."

platform. The most irritating isue I have found is that i cannot download 
code from my current course ""Creative programming for digital media and 
mobile apps"" so I have to go to the webpage to get all my stuff. As others 
have mentioned, you should be able to write to sd card. A built in calendar 
would be nice."
8664,"In the new interface, users are more likely to misbehavior on the switch to

8673,It is very useful
8674,Awesome apps!‚ô•‚ô°
8675,"Great app! I loved the new design but the performance of the offline 
feature should improve. Also, when I audit the courses, those graded 
assignments should be excluded from the requirement of ""completing"" an 
audited course. It's annoying to have the app tell me to join the next 
class when I've already viewed the materials (lectures, practice questions 
etc.) of the audited course."

8696,"I really appreciate this because it allows people to always have access and the ability to better there knowledge. So thank you!!!. . . . . . . One thing I want to suggest is a watch/reminder, or favorites/interested option to select like a star symbol or something to click on so you can know which other lessons you want to sign up for later or when you don't have as many lessons as, maybe, you do. Ph an less of the instructions just the order, in which that lessons, videos and tests is good enough for me."
8697,nice
8698,Thanks from you
8699,Gave you 5 stars because I've never had the urge to use this app and always worked on desktop. There is no way to bookmark to the Google Play my favorite apps and I have to remove apps to get storage space. Keep the good work!

ingl√©s ya que aparece el texto en la parte inferior y, en general es mucho 
mejor la app con la nueva actualizaci√≥n."
8707,"Is a good app, but doesn't load unless connected to the internet, even if 
you download the content, only videos and some text appears, math doesn't. 
Would be nice to have personal list of favorite courses (my favorites/wish 
list)."

8731,&lt;3
8732,"I love the app, as it's mobile friendly!  Tasted and trusted!"
8733,I think it is best to learn different skills because skills is far valuable than degree
8734,I use coursera on PC but videos on app are of dramatic quality. Other videos o my computer are ok. Content is great here and it's the only reason I don't give 1 star...
8735,Impressive
8736,Great app for studying but Could you add more free courses
8737,I LOVE IT AND IM ONLY 10
8738,Best way to learn

8758,Issues with aspect ratio from last two updates. Both 16:9 and 18:9 settings are not working with full screen.
8759,Great! Having the Coursera app on my phone saves me so much time.
8760,"It takes long time to open the course and show the downloaded videos when there is no internet connection. It also does not mark videos as watched when they were watched offline. When a video is Chromecast, then paused and Chromecast disconnected, it starts to play all videos watched in this session simultaneously."
8761,This amazing app. All time uses users and sharp mind.
8762,awesome app

8812,It will be better if there is an option to choose how many lessons to download if you've a slow connection you want'em all to be downloaded
8813,"This was once a great website. Encouraging learning. Now they just want money. I get it, businesses need cash flow to stay in business. However, this free to pay transition is tantamount to a drug dealer, first hit is free, then we charge."
8814,I have learnt a lot by using this app and I would recommend it to anyone who loves studying
8815,This app is well organized and keeps me on track with everything. I cant see my self with out this app!

After 3 straight weeks of chat assurances that my assignments were received with ""A"" grades, all automated assignment submission and tracking failed. 6 weeks of work for nothing, and they barely approved a refund. So disappointed."

8839,Is flexible and user friendly
8840,Courses is a great platform for everyone learn to anything
8841,"While Coursera is a great platform and I love the resources, the app itself is a PITA to use, at least on my pixel.   The full screen button on videos doesn't seem to work in landscape, and is completely offscreen when in portrait mode. The controls do not lay themselves out according to screen size very well.   Further, the pull down menu doesn't seem to go away when using the back button, which is unintuitive as someone who has used Android for some time, since that would be expected behavior.   However, I can't give too bad a rating as the app at least does work to some extent and I'm very pleased with Coursera as a whole, especially their normal web interface. The app just needs some work."
8842,Thanks for this app... i can continue my course even if m not at my office.
8843,New format for your current courses is a PITA to navigate
8844,Real place for study online
8845,"I downloaded this app for the first time about 3 years ago, but deleted it because it still had so many bugs. So it has been great to see the improvements made. It certain functions the application is more user friendly that the website. A shortcoming however is seeing assignements results and comments in the application."
8846,Absolutely Amazing!!
8847,I feel happy when I start my lessons
8848,Great Courses in Coursea!
8849,Great for polymaths
8850,Nice app
8851,"Pls add the ability to sort between paid and free courses. Secondly,add the ability to search via university name along with Courses. Thirdly, on search when we select the course and then press the back button it takes us to the homescreen. Rather it should take back to the search result"
8852,GOOD
8853,new and very helpful course for get lots of  well chances in future of jobs by google it support professional certificate.

8855,Very bad

8858,Worldwide universities course
8859,"It gave a lot of support for my further education than my school works. I LOVE THIS and I share this with my friends, then they also. &lt; 3"
8860,It is a good app but this mostly has University Courses. If there were courses for schools and all it would be better. Along with a child mode because the forums are great but for children maybe not so much.

8888,"Assignment submited through this app, doesn't store in an accessible way. It's a major bug. Plse check"
8889,"The service is good but the app is broken in a few crucial ways. Like quizzes, which will let you start, work on, and finish a quiz before telling you there was a connection error at the end, it doesn't save your results and you don't get feedback. Waste of time and effort to attempt quizzes on mobile. Making the app just a little bit pointless."
8890,App is heavy load even i am using 820 snapdragon processer and high speed network.but the website is load free and fast.
8891,"Coursera for Android looks and works great but I have one gripe, when I uploaded my photo from my laptop it displays my photo in the wrong orientation with in the app."
8892,I'm not able to log in or sign up. Please fix it.
8893,So nice
8894,Thanks a lot for helping people to improve and expand their knowledge
8895,It is a very cool way to learn new things from your phone without having to go to a real school anymore. Just the greatest idea. I just hope there wouldn't be any ads and any glitches to this app as I am going to change the ratings if it has such. Thank you for your help you guys.
8896,Just downloaded

I have suggested this app to friends already, an at least 1 signed up.. I love that you have the option of taking the courses for free! There is nothing I don't like about this app, thank you so much for making it!!!"
8918,The basic disadvantage that an indian cannot pay the course fee to earn a certificate though the price is given in INR. Not many of us have international debit or credit card. Must need improvement here.
8919,Nice app..
8920,Fantastic design overhaul
8921,Amazing educational resource

8956,Nice
8957,"This app would have 5 stars if it wasn't plagued with  really annoying bugs. To boot, the app fails miserably to realize when you are offline. The whole point of downloading videos on your phone is to watch them when you are on the go. This app will show an hourglass for literally minutes and minutes, before eventually realizing it's not connected to the net and try at last to read the stored videos. This is really annoying and should be fixed.  The second really annoying bug is losing track of where you were in your videos. If you stop your videos for whatever reason, next time you re-open the app, the video restart from the beginning instead of restarting where you last stopped. Again, really annoying.  If these 2 problems could be fixed, I'd give a 5 stars"
8958,Amazing !

9290,"You guys have a great website but the app needs improvement.. on a galaxy tablet n8010 it takes up a lot of RAM and keeps freezing. The videos are impossible to play without a download even if there is a good wifi connection and you don't get any notes/tutorial , aterials on the app - basically coursera is great but you can only get the full experience on chrome instead of the app"
9291,Bugs....
9292,Awesome
9293,"I love Coursera because I've learned useful things there, but their app, though great because it tries to squeeze Coursera's system into my phone, often distresses me. Everyone who went to college suffers from a post-scholastic stress syndrome manifest in dreams of being handed an exam in an unknown language or dreams of getting to class and realizing they forgot to dress. The Coursera app recreates that anxiety by reporting as incomplete lessons I turned in weeks ago, so every time I use the app I then have to rush to my laptop to see if something I completed a week ago is really incomplete. It's nerve-wracking and seriously detracts from what otherwise would make a great University of Phone."
9294,A recent update to this app created major glitches accessing weekly materials. When is this going to be fixed??!
9295,Good app
9296,"The service is great, but the app still does not cast the videos on Chromecast. If this feature was available, it would be 5 stars"

9335,"App allows you to download course material, but you can't access the downloaded material unless you're online. It makes it significantly less useful."
9336,1. There are some technical glitches in the app. 2. The app stores your payment information and subscription is renewed without any prior intimation.

9374,can this app be installed on a laptop ?
9375,The app consistently won't cast to Chromecast correctly.
9376,The timeless wisdom of the greats and the brilliance of the Ivy league combined with an app so frustrating it will make you want to hurl your phone across the room. If the content weren't so amazing I would never put up with this app's many shortcomings.
9377,Used to like it ..but they are very inflexible and the content is a bit erratic.. you are better off with other options..

9412,Processed perfectly.

You don't get a certificate for the class unless you pass the class & actually pay the enrollment fee. Textbooks, Syllabus, Workbook are all accessed online for no fee. Finical Aid is also available if submitted."
9444,The app is terrible The peer review assignments are a task as there's always some error
9445,To become learned on the go this is one of the Most valuable app.
9446,This app is cool but doesn't offer any recovery feature for when the user submits a quiz and a nerwork error occurs. All the quiz answers will be lost.

9502,Its an awesome opportunity to live in home town and have a lecture from the best universities and great teachers....realy helps me to enhace my knowledge
9503,I thik it's great
9504,Excellent!
9505,"Great variety of courses, from digital currency to big history. No cost if you don't need/want a certificate of completion."
9506,Good informative easy to use app
9507,It's best
9508,AWESOME
9509,"It's very helpfull, i love it!!"
9510,It helps me when ever I need help :'-)
9511,"Inspiring, functipnal, time-worth spending."
9512,The course English for journalism is Very useful but it's volume is very very  low  so I don't use it
9513,I'd appreciate it even further if you'd release a Lite version of the app.
9514,Good platform to learn
9515,Great opportunity open to those who want to advance themselves
9516,Am very interested in learning on line
9517,"App is big with every update. There is no button for setting video resolution . sometimes the internet is slow and I can't watch videos I want 240p , 320p videos options."
9518,Okay
9519,Awesome
9520,"Courses are great. The app is terrible. You cannot review assignment feedback in the app. Also if courses use podcasts these can only be downloaded via the Web.  Was really looking forward to learning on the go, but not with this."
9521,"No more free courses. I used to love Coursera, nothing came close to its quality. Now it's the worst one. All classes must be paid for in advance. Meanwhile,  competing online courses services like EdX,  Cybrary,  Udemy etc all have free options asking for money only if u want a certificate, some even give free certificates. Coursera is now the worst option for online courses and doesn't even have half of the courses offered by it's competition.   I'm sorry Coursera it was nice while it lasted. But in leaving you. I'll be at EdX taking courses from some of the best professors of the best campuses in the world - free of charge."
9522,Gives you all the information what you want
9523,Good app
9524,I can't login through Facebook.
9525,Awesome
9526,Fine
9527,Great
9528,Great app
9529,"Allows you to follow your courses on the go, for the most part.  What's really annoying is that the fibrin for speeding the video doesn't work. Images indeed go faster, but the audio remains at normal speed."
9530,Seems to be working fine. Will edit my review after I've done the course for a bit.
9531,Perfect for those who wish to upgrade their knowledge
9532,No
9533,Best app for online education and knowledge
9534,The facility of downloading video lectures has helped a lot. I can download at wi fi and watch it as per my time. Also if slides or lecture notes are made available offline it would help much. Overall an excellent app.
9535,Very helpful and good
9536,Fantastic courses offered by Professors from renowned university
9537,It's good but where we can know how long will a certain course take? Time period of courses? Each day lecture timings and all?
9538,One of the best app for motivator to achieve self development to continue‚Äã learn everyday from their mobile while they are offline.
9539,I am unable to access any courses via the app. There was no problem before until today
9540,thx

9551,Nice
9552,"Some of the links are broken. When I browse the listings of courses, I can't click on some of them to check them out. Disappointing."
9553,"The video player keeps on crashing. Msg says: ""Oops Something went wrong while playing this video. Please exit the player and try again.                                                   OK"".  Once this happens you can't play any cost video until you uninstall and reinstall the app."
9554,Best app for MOOC.  Could have given 5 stars if the download can resume from where it stopped. It cancels the download when there is a problem in cellular network and then starts from beginning.
9555,The best way to learn things you liked but never got an opportunity to do it in life.
9556,"There isn't what i think this apple, but i expect to be a good apple , how i advantage its outcome"
9557,Got this for something similar to itunes U - its not even close
9558,"The video is sometimes delayed opposed to the sound. Sometimes when skipping to another part of the video, a frame will stay frozen."
9559,Amazing
9560,Excellent
9561,Very good app for online learning. Works very well and it is easy to use and also its design is best in all available mooc apps.
9562,"Many bugs when using play speeds other than 1: asynchronous A/V (when watching more than one video per session), quizzes popping up at the wrong time. These problems have been going on for a while, disappointing that they haven't been fixed yet"
9563,I took a class on cloud computing.  I got tested on material that was not covered by the videos and printed material. Not recommended.
9564,It is not free bakwaas
9565,Lectures are really good .....but the worst part is that there is NO  assignment pdf files as they say in the video .....and the videos are not clear
9566,It is the best educational app I've ever downloaded.
9567,Very useful
9568,makes me smarter
9569,Rocking  App
9570,Something went wrong. Please check your Internet connection and try again. On every video

9603,Great resource
9604,Nice one
9605,Sex
9606,"Convenient app for accessing Coursera courses. However, there is one bug that annoys me. I often set my video speed to 1.5 or 2 times faster. Everytime I close a course video and rewatch it again, the app still remembers to set the video speed to my last setting, which is good. However, the video and audio becomes out of sync. The audio speed still follows normal speed, but the video follows the set speed (e.g. 2x speed). Please fix this bug."
9607,I would like to study with you in Public Health

9616,This is really good app
9617,just amazing
9618,Pictures during quizzes often fail to load. Explanations for completed quiz answers are not shown. There is no ability to rate or provide feedback via the app. It's basically just lacking some key features on the desktop site.
9619,Educational
9620,All corses are paid ...
9621,Amazing Courses Thank You Andrew Ng
9622,Winderful
9623,An amazing app to learn anything on finger tips. I love coursera.
9624,This is the best app I have been ever used for online study
9625,Love coursera
9626,Awesome!
9627,"It would have been better, if it had all the features that are present in the coursera website"
9628,It's better now. I can watch my offline video without any error. Keep it up buddy!!
9629,"Awesome,this app is."
9630,Good
9631,Die to yourself.
9632,A really great learning experience
9633,Best app ever to creat your future
9634,Works well for course modules but where are the discussion forums which I see on the web page?
9635,Good
9636,Can you please make adjustable the side of subtitles in videos? On tablets its very difficult top read
9637,Best in its category...
9638,It loads each page so slowly...
9639,Great app‚ù§
9640,Help to student and research person
9641,Why location

9643,Awesome
9644,Please add a feature to shortlist and add courses to favorites so that I can shortlist courses and then decide on what I want to do!
9645,"After update , all the Downloads become useless. Again download to play with app!!!"
9646,"It's been 30 years since I made any attempt at an education so this was a long shot to begin with. Unfortunately I've pretty much gone through any patience with this program already and the books haven't even arrived yet. I have issues with PayPal so I went to change the payment method and all I got was caught in a loop, like in the twilight zone. It's got a link which clearly says, UPDATE PAYMENT METHOD, but when you click it, the best it would let me do was deactivate the account, confusing, but that's what I did. Instead of trying for the certificate it might be best if I just look over the material and not take some silly certificate so serious. I've made it 43 year's with a 7th grade education I'm pretty I can die with one and it'll be okay too. Thanks for making me feel worse than when I started, again, Coursera."
9647,Useful platform
9648,Kkk
9649,Great exposure!!!
9650,"I am downloading it,  Do I get Certificate after completion of Course via this application???"
9651,It's good app.
9652,"01/09/17 downloading lectures is still unreliable, eventually they stop working and no amount of deleting and reinstalling the app helps. As a commuter app, it is very limited. Whilst you can download lectures, you can still only access the list of downloads whilst connected to the internet, so it's hopeless for a commute without signal. The support team also treat you like a moron.  Older review:  Latest version still has all the same problems. Downloaded videos stop working every time the app updates, so you have to download them again. Incredibly annoying!   Downloading materiay ls does not work well at all. It seems to require a network connection to load the page that lists your downloads, making it pretty pointless, and it also frequently somehow loses downloads so they don't appear as downloaded in the course page despite the files being present. This is very basic functionality that is unreliable at best."
9653,Nc
9654,I suggested you should download it
9655,"An extra star for the app interface, but Coursera has changed in recent years away from being a free site. A lot of course content isn't available without paying, and without completing this content Coursera continually marks you as behind and overdue. Could be better if there was an option to manually mark each week as complete and not be made to feel bad for the assignments that aren't available."
9656,Keep getting error loading enrollment data. Any1 help!
9657,"Great app with interesting courses, BUT please fix errors in Android version! 1) When you enter answer to some question in quiz and then after sometime you return to it the text in answer field breaks, displayed answer is the same , but in field there some code(maybe latex), and if you press submit it will submit these wrong text  and answer will be wrong. It's really annoying when you check your answers and they breaks so you need to re-enter them."
9658,Wonderful app please make app available for amazon firsestick
9659,Nice
9660,Appreciate this type of apps that makes you have learning tools handy.
9661,It is better to keep offline videos
9662,Awesome
9663,Wasn't able to login to even try the app. I press log in with facebook and nothing happens. Same with sign up with facebook.
9664,This is an amazing app. Do try.
9665,Its amazing app
9666,"Notice a problem, that pictures in summary or the test in video are always having trouble to fully load."
9667,Very helpful .
9668,"Great app... Sadly, Course team is turning this entrepreneur out of a global learning üò∂"
9669,I I'll tell later .my comments

9671,I think that people are getting quality Education front this app are really thankful for the developers.
9672,Good
9673,Love it
9674,good!
9675,"Strange new permissions. Device id, call info."
9676,"Great app, great courses. Informative and professional - everything TED talks is not."
9677,Not so many courses for mechanical engineering and that's bad ....
9678,Its awesome to learn from renewed university professors luved it ! :)
9679,Nice video
9680,I just want to clarify if enrolling in a certain lecture is totally free?
9681,This is the best app to develop our own carrier
9682,You can fin courses of anything
9683,So nice.thanks
9684,"Nice app but it stopped downloading video for off-line viewing and that pretty much killed it for me. It just say ""please try downloading again"""
9685,"Since the new update and every thing I downloaded was removed , and when I try to download it again the download don't continue the process and I get ""couldn't download"" although I have an enough space for those videos , please fix that üò≠üò≠"
9686,Well i have been remonitorized from these courses i just dont feel thats me again i have changed Now my dream of one day being a journalist can be fullfilled
9687,Wonderful contribution to people!
9688,Good app to learn at home
9689,Unoi
9690,Love this app it is very useful
9691,Good
9692,"The idea is just great, but I have have some stabillity issues related with the offline mode"
9693,Good
9694,"I like it. It's really easy to use and convenient. Now, if only I could get my schedule to match a full class schedule..."
9695,Its a very useful app for your online courses search
9696,"I tried using the app on an Android tablet because I don't have Wi-Fi for my computer. The app won't let my tablet download or watch videos. I've used Coursera in the past and loved it and was so glad when they made the app, but until they fix the app it will remain a one for not functioning properly."
9697,"Mucho cuidado con el nuevo sistema de pagos. Me apunte a un curso, lo termine con la nota m√°xima, y 2 semanas despu√©s de terminar me han vuelto a cobrar el mismo curso. Para colmo lo hacen sin notificaci√≥n previa (me he enterado por el aviso del banco). Y por si todo eso fuera poco se niegan a efectuar la devoluci√≥n.  Un robo en toda regla a un cliente que ha gastado mucho dinero en sus cursos."
9698,"I'm not able to submit the answers to my quizzes on the app (even after making the payment for the specialization). When I tap on ""Submit"" and then ""Continue"", the app asks me to ""Purchase"" before I can submit and I have purchased already. It works on the web though. Also, if I accidentally exit the app while watching a video, the video starts from the beginning when I go back to it. Please fix the app!"
9699,mooc
9700,"How is it ""online"" if it involves a download.."
9701,V good
9702,The only app i would recommend to anyone without hesitation
9703,Useful
9704,"Loved it, worked interface"
9705,"I wanna know, if it is a paid app ??"
9706,Very good!!!!!  And very helpfull
9707,"A good verity in courses. Heard good things about this company. However, did not expect them to have such bad payment options."
9708,It's a very useful resource for learning
9709,"Great app, easy to use and well designed."
9710,"While the option to download videos for offline use is wonderful, it would be even more wonderful if it worked reliably.  Too often, when it's time to access the videos, I get ""Something is wrong with the downloaded video file.  Would you like to re-download the file?"" I'm usually not in a good downloading place (unlimited internet data) and a good studying place (quiet, few distractions) at the same time.  It's frustrating to have my study schedule disrupted because the app doesn't check its own downloads for integrity."
9711,Super like mastero
9712,i like that
9713,Awesome app
9714,Good i like it
9715,"Can't log in with email/password, it says network error but I was able to download and rate this app with the same network. Multiple attempts, no success. I'm not going to use Facebook. Coursera is great though. I'm only not satisfied with this app."
9716,Excellent
9717,It's very important app for me tenx
9718,Best learning experience with interactive lectures ...
9719,Enables one to watch video lecture on phone. Well built with features better than any other edu app.
9720,"It worked the first week, now every time I try to resume the course it says ""downloading"" and stays there forever."
9721,The Courses are great but the app is rediculous... It refuses to let me download the videos for offline and the app is ALWAYS crashing when you are actually trying to watch your courses which you paid for. I have tested mutiple devices and different internet venues... Nothing works. Very very dissapointed.
9722,"Once network lost ,and even after connecting successfully to a network it keeps throwing message ""no network connection found """
9723,Very reliable
9724,"I will gladly change this rating with the improvement of the app. It's been extremely difficult submitting my work through the app, which does not reflect my submission. It says it's overdue. I literally wore myself out trying to submit over & over again. I'm taking a break out of pure frustration, but will try again tomorrow."
9725,"Tried again after a long break. This time app rendered near-useless as images won't show (Nexus 5) in questionnaires, mid-video or graded ones. Too bad."
9726,Great app
9727,Awesome...
9728,Nice courses
9729,It is impossible to use the app. Gets hang always
9730,Financial aid service is the best for the students  who are weaker wealth wise. Great coursera
9731,"Good app, very helpful"
9732,It is not as user friendly as needs be - won't mark some tasks as finished and keeps shutting down
9733,I liked it and all but can I download videos using mobile data?
9734,One of the best online course provider with a wide range of courses.
9735,"Coursera is free and without ads by itself but for all the courses offered there you must pay for certificate, and some of them you can't even attend without paying."
9736,great and splendid apps
9737,Love it
9738,Course are good but app is not good... I am not able to download the courses
9739,This app is great
9740,"Awesome app, but should include topics and information which continues to be omitted from the educational system in place."
9741,Pretty cool
9742,Needs improvement. Is slow and crashes sometimes. Needs to be optimised for faster performance. Cast does not perform well.
9743,Loved it
9744,Best platform to have  knowledgeable stuff
9745,Wonderful
9746,Really a star app for a mordern unproductive busy life nowdays

9749,Very very useful
9750,Rewarding experience
9751,"Deletes downloaded lections on sd on application update. You have to disable autoupdate to work with the app. Otherwise, quite useful"
9752,"Maybe not the best as an app,but really just amazing for courses.It helped a lot"
9753,Big fan of it
9754,Very good
9755,Can't login  It says check network connection But I obviously can access the internet
9756,Great App to complement the life-changing Coursera website platform.What's not to like?Kudos Coursera!!!
9757,Good
9758,"While the classes may be good, I wouldn't know. Every single course I wanted to take required a monthly subscription of $50 or more. They should tell you up front that the courses are not free."
9759,More free courses
9760,Awesome
9761,Very educational
9762,This is app very very good

9768,Awesome....
9769,It's awesum to be part of this project
9770,Best Teaching..
9771,Coursera is great but this app is frustrating.  My main issue is that the page for submitting written assignments never loads correctly.  I get a spinning wheel in the middle of the page which never goes away and there is a 5-10 second lag time between pushing a key and the letter actually appearing.  This is truly maddening when you're trying to complete your assignments.
9772,Good
9773,Easy to use nd learn
9774,Brilliant... Because of this app... M going to achieve great career path
9775,This is bettter because best online course learning easly

9813,"Very nice app with structured e learning courses, daily and weekly schedules, assignments, study materials and most important being learning under one of the great lecturers who inspires you and brings motivation in your life."

9846,"The offline mode is very important, keep improving it."
9847,Expensive
9848,Do these courses provide certificates???
9849,Great course finder apps
9850,"Emails are impossible to turn off, even after the app is deleted and you dont want it any more. Very annoying. &gt;:("
9851,It's excellent apps for technical students
9852,Buggy app
9853,Special recommended for poor family
9854,The best education app
9855,"Really annoying when the only login support is Facebook. Please at least add Google accounts. Really good course range but, can't recommend the app with such a poor mobile implementation."
9856,How to use offline mode
9857,"Playback speed is desirable to be more than 2x for skimming. Please make it up to 4x, or support playing the video through external player. Currently many video players support 4x."
9858,Firstly check out about your designation then rate it üòä
9859,"Some functionalities don't work (for example you can't see replies to thread in the forum; the buttons for ""upvote"" and reply sometimes work and sometimes don't), the application loads new pages very slow (tried with three different networks)."
9860,I hope it will help me learn more in less time.
9861,It is good
9862,Nice to keep you updated through online learning
9863,Helpful
9864,Good
9865,I really love it!!!
9866,It's amazing.
9867,Great source of knowledge!
9868,I think this app is so useful nd I am in love with this app
9869,Fantastic
9870,Best app for free education on the market.
9871,Goodluck
9872,Not able to save videos offline and when it's saved it removed on the next day
9873,"While Coursera is excellent, the developers of this app should go through some app development courses again.  A basic point- the app can't quickly switch to mobile data when WiFi gets out of range.  The download function is as if written by a beginner. For a simple network change from one WiFi to other, the app ditches 90% complete video and starts downloading from the beginning..."
9874,Educational programs are better in world
9875,It's a great app for leaning specially an offline feature.
9876,It's a great app.love to have download feature to project it on projector.
9877,It is nice way of learning but it can be improved.
9878,Offline and transcription handling are brilliant. A really excellent resource for anyone.
9879,Awesome app
9880,Coursera is extremely useful. The app is seamless.
9881,It's awesome app...üòä
9882,The course selections are great. And able to download and view offline are nice features. But i keep losing my downloaded files randomly. I don't know why that keeps happening.
9883,Brilliant.
9884,Study where ever üëç
9885,Works properly.
9886,really a wonderful Platform to be Smarter
9887,Best App on the Earth. Seriously.
9888,Coursera is not dedicated to providing quality education and its high time they step down as an MOOC with others showing up better online students no longer need them. Udmey provides cheaper courses as low as $10 and triple the free courses with certificates than coursera. My conclusion is that if you offer something offer it properly or not at all.
9889,nice App
9890,Nothing's been loading recently ):

9981,So much has changed over the years. It's a wonderful experience to be on Coursera.

9991,I love the access to free courses and the app works very well. My only wish for the app (and website) would be a way to favorite or save a course we might be interested in in the future. I have multiple draft emails to myself of links to courses I find interesting so I don't have to keep scrolling and searching to find them.

My family is supportive of my stance about the fact that college is irrelevant. Coursera is my bae, my everything. I've already gotten job opportunities in places like Morgan Stanley, Pearson Hardman, iyengar bakery , to name a few.. DOWNLOAD IT NOW FOR A CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE PATH"
10011,I love open source learning.
10012,Good offer to me
10013,Oops something went wrong with player try again... constantly getting this error while trying online as well as offline

10025,"So far I have been very satisfied with the courses I am taking, and mostly happy with the app. The audio can get a bit fuzzy at times but for the most part everything has run smoothly. Thankfully the subtitles work fine so if I can't hear it, I usually just read the transcript."
10026,Cannot enroll any course
10027,Either the search algorithm or the courses are garbage. Couldn't find any algebra classes in English or any sort of ACT Prep whatsoever. It just suggests completely unrelated courses like Robotics... Useless.
10028,Thanks for all things to give us a chance to study with you
10029,I love it
10030,I just started because my daughter tried it and the class was a secession for her thank you i just love the online class
10031,No videos for offline couple of days after downloading everything. This is the third time I downloaded whole the videos and lost everything. Are you guys even bothering to look into this? Because this is my second review on this problem but didn't get a feedback from the developers. This is so bad.
10032,The app is very easy to operatre and the courses are amazing.
10033,Let's your download videos for offline mode. It does NOT let you view the videos that are downloaded onto your phone.
10034,"Video not playing after update.  ""ooops, something went wrong.. "" Nexus 4 android 5.1.1"

10039,can change life
10040,"App is very good. For people, ""video not playing"" make sure you have very good internet connection (5mbps atleast) for good quality videos. But the only defect is when my phone is connected to internet and while at the end of the video, when I press back, the video still plays in the background (only sound) and the contents are loading at the same time. Please fix that."
10041,Very useful for study from anywhere‚Äã

10307,i think this is wonderful and cheaper way to learn.thank you
10308,Awesome app
10309,Can Coursera give the option of screen casting?
10310,Great app for learning

10319,Slow. Latest version crashes TouchWiz very often on Samsung s5 active
10320,I love platform provided by Coursera for learning. I have taken 4 course certificates. I was enjoying using it till payments could be made through Paytm wallet or Debit card or Paypal through the mobile application. Now I'm unable to pay for a course though the application by any payment method other than Credit Card. Please fix this!
10321,Every programmer should use this.
10322,"Everything is great but for one thing. What is the point of making downloadable course materials if you can't access them without the Internet? There is a nice course ""Introduction to Logic"")"
10323,Its one of  the Best educational app I have come across ... Go for it

10343,"Unenrolling to a course can only be done on a desktop site and it is time consuming. It would save time if we could access it within the application. Keeping the above aside, the application has been very useful and friendly."
10344,It's sad that you don't provide Honor Code Certificates anymore. RIP free education.
10345,Not free
10346,Coursera is an amazing tool for the 21st century. Lots of specialisation courses to improve your personal  development.
10347,I love this app. But lately it's crashing a lot. Can you guys fix it?
10348,Useful
10349,This is a  amazing app
10350,The app is a huge battery drain while downloading offline videos. Also the phone gets heated up unusually.  It's a good platform. The app can be optimized for better battery life.
10351,Nice app yo
10352,"Coursera is a great idea and helped me a lot in the past. But one major issue I had with this app is that it keeps removing the offline videos I downloaded, which prevents me from using this app while commuting."

10386,Nice experience and it's accessible to everyone.
10387,Helpfull
10388,No option for selecting the quality of the video.The video keeps on fluctuating to low and high quality based on the internet speed which is  quite irritating.
10389,"Please, I switched to offline and now i want to return to the online version but can't seem to find the option"

10399,On the go and contents.

10405,Best app i have  ever used
10406,It is a great app
10407,useful
10408,"Very slow interface. Does it pull all data for all courses each time? If you have a slow internet connection and if you click 5 times  ""Next item"" link in a quiz - it will open it 5 times in the end. Tends to loose previously saved videos without a reason. I don't think Coursera can afford such application."
10409,Very Good apps.
10410,The best!!
10411,Cool app
10412,"I can not get this app , I find this sentence ÿåÿå your device already has this item installed ÿåÿå what is wrong ??"
10413,Makes easy to learn more effectively online courses.
10414,Loved it
10415,A very good must have application
10416,Most easygoing
10417,Unable to access the videos or do the quizzes on my phone even though I've already updated it :(
10418,"Its one of the best things i have ever come across. Just a little technical problems, when they are solved its good to go. The videos don't continue where you left them when watching online. Suddenly the app runs into problems and have to exit midway. Watching the whole lecture again, cause if you try playing it from somewhere in the middle it keeps loading and replaying the same few seconds. Also it hangs a lot!! Sometimes when I am in the mood to listen to a lecture it won't just work right."
10419,"I love everything about coursera! I stumbled across coursera years ago and I'm happy to see they are growing.  Offering a plethora of classes from a variety of prestigious schools, there's a huge selection of interesting subjects to choose from, conveniently accessible from the palm of your hand! Learn something new or sharpen your skills. Keep up the amazing work!"
10420,"This used to be a pretty good app for a great site. Now I can't even seem to sign up so any new courses, or download videos. Really dissapointed."
10421,Excellent but there is no sign in via gmail
10422,"I started a music course, which I liked and want to purchase it, but there are glitches in the exercises and  quizzes. There are few questions whose options are audio clip based and I was not able to listen to the audio of the options ! Leading to the failure in that course.  please correct the glitch then I will buy the course plss"
10423,Awesome
10424,Best online education application. Soft and easy to use.

10426,Fantastic app
10427,Awesome
10428,Lovely and great app
10429,Lovely
10430,The latest update is very buggy. I can' even successfully save all the videos for one course! Installed and reinstalled over and over but still won't let me. I hope they just didn't update it. It was working perfectly the past 2 months that I started taking MOOCs.
10431,It will better if it has option to store data on the SD card
10432,Poor
10433,"Thank goodness the content of Coursera isn't as bad as this app.  You can't use this offline unless you are at certain points, and then if you have to restart the app (because the video becomes a white screen) then you have to get internet again.  This is such a lackluster app, it borders on completely unusable."
10434,"No one can rival what the people on coursera have been doing, you guys are truly geniuses"
10435,Gr8 App
10436,I feel lucky to live in a Era bcs of Mooc's where I can learn endlessly from the universities and teachers that I can't even dream of in real life. Thanx aton
10437,I used coursera on  computer and  loved it

10448,ÿπÿßŸÑ€å
10449,Wow
10450,Wish I had this years ago. Easy to use and learn any subject.
10451,Too difficult to see and work with downloaded files. There is no place to see and remove downloaded files other than in each courses pages. For the majority of us would have more than one course that means you have to go into each course and hunt for what you downloaded to free up space. Horribly inefficient compared to other apps.
10452,Good app for distance learning programs
10453,"Horrible ux. Please see Amazon app. You have online courses but we need more than a quick search. Filters, ratings, etc"
10454,Great app

10467,"Amazing self-drive courses to advance ones mind for future or just self-fullfilment.  Option for certificates  is excellent benefit, as well."
10468,"Everytime I update the app, saved videos get deleted"
10469,It's good for leaning
10470,Courses are very easy. Not much helpful. One would better but a textbook and read it him (/her)self
10471,Superb to people who want to aspire knowledge!
10472,It's‚Äã amazing.
10473,Performance is slow after updating the app....    App is hanging too much... Low performance while submitting assignments
10474,"sorry to say, but the app troubled me so much. IT often crashes."
10475,"Awesome app, coursera you rock!!"
10476,"Awesome app content courses but , I have to give you whopping 3000-5000 Rs per month for your courses , please don't be such merciless. I know it's business for you people but I see this is medium to learn something."
10477,It would be really fabulous
10478,Good app for learning. Only downside is the app sometimes freezes my HTC m8 mobile. This is the only app that freeze my mob and I use lots of apps.
10479,Really. Nice
10480,coursera is very good
10481,Best place to learn new things for everyone...Thank you coursera

10490,Easy to learn by this
10491,A gift to mankind from Andrew Ng
10492,I wish they would have been more clear on what age group it was meant for .......
10493,The video and sound quality is very poor compared to the same videos watched in an internet browser
10494,Wonderful
10495,"To learn More, TO share knowledge,  to save Mother Earth,  to keep creator's Creations"
10496,One of the best trusted educational app
10497,How to unenroll from the subscription
10498,"Tests cannot be done offline, too bad there are rooted devices. This application should notify the amount of space to be taken by a multiple download."
10499,"An excellent app, no doubt!"
10500,Very good and tremendous environment
10501,ok very useful apps
10502,Dont miss this app

10506,The best educational app but it will be great to add a section for the completed or finished courses
10507,Amazing learning‚Äã platform !
10508,It's my favorite educational app
10509,Time taken for querying even small data is too high by any standards.
10510,Good app. Status sinking after being offline fails quite often
10511,Can't sign in with Gmail account. Getting network error after long time. Very critical error. Should be fixed ASAP
10512,Changed my life!
10513,Nice
10514,I got excellent education by this app
10515,A very nice app to build ur concepts strong
10516,Can't login with my Gmail account.  I have signed up with Gmail earlier.
10517,Excellent and informative online courses
10518,Great app but should have reminders for this reason am outüòÇüòÇ
10519,Coursera has abandoned what was once its core principal and mission.
10520,HATE THE NEW POLICY
10521,I think you should make more free online courses. Thanks
10522,Very useful app
10523,Brilliant app with awesome content. The offline videos yet seems to be corrupted after each update and I should download some of them again.
10524,I would recomend to add a filtering feature that allows the user to filter the courses based on their price ( if the course is free or not)
10525,I like how the app seamlessly updates my progress so I can switch platforms and carry on learning without worrying about my records not being updated.
10526,"The app is improving over time, plus there are more and more high quality courses to learn from."
10527,Simply great.
10528,Great app
10529,Prefer destop version. This app still says i haven't started a course when I'm half way through week one. Also deadline for 1st assessment says 27/3 but on desktop version says 26/3
10530,Futuristic endeavors. But need speed controls in app
10531,"This is an incredible app,i do not see anything to criticize in it."
10532,Does not get past login screen (Android Pixel XL logging in via Facebook)
10533,Absolutely fantastic app who are hungry to learn
10534,Great app
10535,O yea
10536,Helpful for the students to engage in new disciplines.
10537,"Not as much classes as I would like,"
10538,Can't login even after signing up screen doesn't go beyond that only other option is to log out and you have all my details but I can't use your app...
10539,Good for students
10540,"CANNOT LOGIN! Very frustrating, even re-installed and gave all permissions. I created my account via my Facebook account."
10541,A wonderful platform for learning and catch up or filling gaps from past experience!
10542,Best collection of courses. Offline content is very helpful. Would love to see a feature to enable categorizing my courses.
10543,"Unable to get beyond login screen. Previously i couldn't register for any classes, it just said Loading."
10544,Good courses
10545,Good
10546,It is a good facility to get a good course and also free
10547,Please fix bugs in quizzes with audio. I could only choose the option but couldn't really play the audio
10548,Login screen is all I see hmmmm wat a shame

10554,Great app and subtitles for the videos is nice. Keep it up.
10555,"This is my obsession. I've been hooked on coursera for over a year now, and unlike other apps and websites that quickly lose their luster, coursera continues to be my favorite because not only is it easy and enjoyable to use, but it also adds value to my life with every course. In short, I highly recommend it."

10564,I want to get certificate :)
10565,Wonderful app
10566,I can't verify my account every time I click on take photo it just do nothing
10567,"The app does not allow for script screen, so I can't write and take notes as I see the videos. Also,  on some screens, the app does not allow for screen rotation. So, Coursera is great, 7 stars for that, but this app is just average."
10568,Not free..so sad not helpfulüòïüòï
10569,Don't try the support you type away to have it all electronically ignored. The quizzes never tell you your wrong only if your right
10570,Need to pay for most of the courses.  Was really nice before universities become too greedy
10571,"Excellent, Convenient and with Full of Knowledge"
10572,nice Application

10577,Nice Application (MOOC)
10578,"First, am surprised to find an app of Coursera!!"
10579,Best one...I have seen
10580,Would be better Coursera if you offered access to all of the content and curriculum of your classes entirely free. By not doing so you play a role as a catalyst to the growing divide between the rich and the poor.... Because the poor are willing to pay will never justify you charging them. Education must change how the world works. Be the first to leave money behind and put real human rights and needs into perspective. The only profit for an educational institution and system is the creation of the educated!
10581,Very nice app
10582,It is manageable and easy to use.
10583,Can't get pass the login stage after login in
10584,I think it is good for the working mother like me
10585,No words! Thank you coursera...
10586,Wonderful learning experience
10587,Good job! Now I can learn wherever I am. Bravo!!!
10588,This app helps me a lot in learning from various international university.
10589,Its amazing app especially saving videos to watch offline really helpful
10590,"New (clean) tablet, WITH tech-approved AV (which includes free secure web browsing, already setup and used) - clicked on ( 2x each) TOS and Privacy Policy links - NEVER loaded.  Scary.  Immediately uninstalled"
10591,Its a good sourse of knowledge and experiances as well. So deep concept to study all about biological sciences nd medical also. But net  nd time consumption is the problem.
10592,I have just started.
10593,Knowledge aquisition at my confort. Great app
10594,Its ok.
10595,The app is amazing for those who want to take knowledge everywhere...
10596,I love this app
10597,My saved videos aren't playing after the update! Why? I downloaded all the videos of the course. So much data is wasted! Please correct this.
10598,It's fantastic.
10599,Nice features
10600,Excellent app. It's really useful as I can access videos offline. It would be great if other materials can also be available offline. If I didn't have this app I wouldn't have enrolled into courses due to lack of time. I use this app when I am on bus.
10601,Awesome
10602,Excellent open learning
10603,Vvvvvv good
10604,it's very nice app #user friendly

10617,Good
10618,The best educational app ever
10619,The videos kept zooming in automatically when its playing. It's so annoying. Hope the developer will fix the bugs.
10620,Nice  4all
10621,Love it
10622,"Overall fairly smooth user experience except on a tablet where it bounces back and forth between portrait and landscape mode in different areas. Since that's my almost exclusive use of the app it's pretty annoying. You'd think at this time that all developers would have made their apps fully tablet compatible... especially for something like this. But Nope.... Add in the forced upgrades, the failure to disclose what is changing in new versions and you have an app that seems to convey a ""customer be damned"" attitude."
10623,Informative
10624,"Great design, even better cause!"
10625,Can I download the videos in dis app?
10626,It is amazing
10627,Amazing
10628,Great app!!
10629,Great app....it works best for me at least.
10630,Good app
10631,Coursera app is good
10632,Great app with world's best courses
10633,Must have app in every phone for learners.
10634,I jst really hate the fact That most courses at this site are now paid! And they're really expensive too!
10635,No complains overall finest app for learning Thank you couraera because of this app i could complete my course
10636,"It's great to have the course material available and to be able to save things offline. But it crashes often. I've gotten the message ""error accessing quiz"" AFTER having completed the quiz/exam, at which point all my answers are thrown away."
10637,It is a great project. Helps me a lot. Great app
10638,I love coursera & thank you so much coursera team for this useful web & app \m/
10639,Keeps crashing
10640,"Every time I use the application, the touch screen stops responding and the mobile restarts."
10641,"Good app, but more limited than the Web version in some aspects"
10642,"Awesome app,ireally like it."
10643,Very helpful nd good platform to explore our potential !
10644,Great app! Plays the audio even if you turn off the screen.
10645,Great place to learn.
10646,It is very useful app but crashes and freezes a lot.
10647,You gotta pay for every little information that you can actually Google. I don't mind paying but their content is just not worth it.
10648,Good app very handy to learn things on the go
10649,"App.review(""Simply"", ""Awesome"");"
10650,It's wonerful app. I take more than one course which make me get high rank.
10651,I may need this when I go to college.
10652,Very nice
10653,I Love it
10654,Good
10655,The app is brilliant but the contents are even more. Love to have app like these on my phone. Worth having them. And a big thanks for spreading knowledge for free. A big salute to you.
10656,The best
10657,Outstanding relevant courses for developing skills
10658,Crashes too much
10659,I love this app
10660,"Usefull app. Easy, userfriendly."
10661,Ive passed some free and some paid courses. Don't like this service since it became completely paid - free courses dont let access to full content (and assignments) anymore.
10662,Very useful app
10663,Good
10664,Very helpful
10665,App is nice
10666,good.
10667,Es una buena manera de seguir aprendiendo
10668,Wonderful learning app. I suggest it to all my students
10669,Used to be great. Now however all the best features are taken away. I liked how the teachers posted recommended reading material and such in the free version. Yes I understand that it's free so you're not going to get the whole deal but it's little stuff like that that made you feel like you're taking a real class. I do however like some of the new upgrades like the grouping of classes and such very helpful.
10670,I tell later
10671,I enjoy learning with this app
10672,"the offline feature was what closed the deal for me. overall interface is great, loving you more everyday, coursera."
10673,Useful
10674,We are grateful from this informative app
10675,Courses are informative. One can learn a lot if she completes the course.
10676,Quality content!
10677,Please add the functionality of increasing the video speed
10678,I love the app but please make it stream to Amazon Fire Stick
10679,Crashes Everytime
10680,"The video optimization part is superb. High quality videos at a very low size, just love that"
10681,Superb app
10682,"Can you please make a video pause for a built-in quiz when played on Chromecast? There are seem to be issues with casting when the app jumps  several titles ahead on a device screen when videos are played on Chromecast, and they are sometimes played in a wrong order."
10683,Awesome app.
10684,Easy tutors great classes
10685,Good
10686,Very good app. Must have by every learner.
10687,It is great. Looking forward to the experience
10688,One of the best educational resources out there. This have been serving me for almost 3 years now.
10689,Offline is good. But the saved videos disappear after few days of saving. Please fix this
10690,A must have app for all the young people out there who want to increase their knowledge. Love this app abd website very muchüëç
10691,Nice app
10692,A great app!
10693,nice
10694,I always get messages saying it has stopped working... please stop this..
10695,Nothing is free here. Disappointed
10696,It looks like Chromecast functionality broken with last update
10697,Useful application
10698,"No stress, just knowledge...."
10699,"Nice ap. Nice to learn new skills. I downloaded while on WiFi, which helped save on data costs, but now it doesn't want to download on my phone anymore."
10700,Nirra ishq
10701,It's easy to use though it freezes sometimes
10702,Nice app
10703,It's a great feeling to have such app on phone. Learning mode is always ON.
10704,Nice and very informative app
10705,Good app to learn
10706,This discovery is amazing.
10707,Educational and useful
10708,Great apps!
10709,Easy to use
10710,Thanks
10711,"A Transcript option in the app itself is what was missing for me; since I prefer to read, rather than listen to the lectures.  The value of the content/education is why I rated this so high, despite that small flaw. I made use of the PC version VIA Internet browser in order to utilize this transcript function & completed my course. These certifications are far from simple, the testing is also done well and demands that you retain the knowledge, before passing each course."
10712,Best Online Education App
10713,Good and ease of access interface with well organized course content.Must have app for a computer science graduate.
10714,"Please fix Bug of Wifi Downloading , when wifi disconnected can't compete download when connected !!!"
10715,Coursera is Nice app for online courses. Saving classes to offline helped me lot. But some times the app crashes without any warning. This is occurring only when I am online
10716,It's not working with mimax prime
10717,The app needs the feature of playing videos from where it was stopped previously.
10718,Excitin
10719,Its more than a teacher ..
10720,Good app
10721,It is beneficial
10722,This app is more useful because having it in your Android is like having the the all instrument that you need for your studies at the same time and you will not need to to go to cyber cafe for class
10723,"For some devices,  when the videos are downloaded, they don't show but they actually download. This needs to be rectified"
10724,Good
10725,"I love coursera and I pay for my courses. However this app needs improvement. The app crashes and freezes on my Nexus 6P. The back button doesn't work properly if I open the app from a notification and leads to the app being dismissed, and I cannot return to the main menu. I think more QA testing would really help here."
10726,Great Learning course
10727,"I downloaded lectures offline to view but when loading them up the app froze numerous times. I couldn't access the home screen buttons whilst the video was playing, I would tap screen but nothing... at one point my screen went dark and wouldn't respond to my double taps. I was worried that I killed my screen. Thankfully rebooting got me back to normal screen.  I will continue subject via laptop."
10728,Great app to get new skills
10729,This is a fast way of getting into the desired resources.  The app has it all and very efficient.
10730,Very nice app.
10731,Awesome app!
10732,Its actually good...
10733,"Terrible app, I've tried to download the videos seveal times without success. It works only online."
10734,IT'S NOT FREE.
10735,Would be great if all the courses were fully supported on mobile
10736,Excellent work
10737,Very useful
10738,"I love it. Need to be able to change the video speed, and to resume the video from where I left it last time."
10739,Just amazing and nothing else
10740,I love them.
10741,I cant find the transcript for the lectures. when I try to get it from the site itself I get re-directed to the video in the app
10742,The pictures won't load so I can't actually take the tests. This happened on my tablet and phone.
10743,Good
10744,Nice
10745,The best educational App ever. I'm loving it.
10746,Awesome
10747,I need my Ph.D
10748,This is easily one of the best apps I've ever used. While I'm at work I use this to keep my mind active instead of just standing around. I only wish it could support split screen so I could take notes concurrently. It's amazing otherwise thank you!
10749,It's really a great educational app and offline mode option for videos is highly appreciate able
10750,Awesome app
10751,Invaluable tool to learn new skills and refresh on old ones.
10752,Good solid app but downloaded videos constantly disappear. So not useful offline where I spend half my time.
10753,great...
10754,Nice
10755,"I installed the app but none of the courses worked. The specializations wouldn't even load, and an error message came up when enrolling for a class. I have used the Web version for years but now I might find another provider with better mobile app services."
10756,"I love Coursera, but I find this app of limited value because I can't speed up the videos. I don't like watching them at normal speed, so I only watch them on PC, rather than using the app. This seems to be device-specific: my Samsung S4 Mini doesn't allow me to view sped-up videos, whereas my partner's Samsung S6 Edge does allow this (important) feature."
10757,GREAT HELP AND OFFER. THANK YOU!
10758,Keep improving!
10759,Not opening ....again I started to download
10760,Osm app

10765,Very helpful in making online study possible.
10766,the review is more about the website and the content. As for the app. I'm still downloading it.. haha
10767,Best educational app
10768,Its a wonderful app.. learning so much each day.. luvd it
10769,Thank you very much Coursera  Very good application but there are some problems in choices.
10770,It's buggy as hell.
10771,Analytics
10772,Please installed it fast
10773,"After recent update, video playing not possible. Video plays for 6seconds and goes refreshing with blank screen"
10774,Perfect
10775,Great app!!!!
10776,One of the best online learning app.
10777,Excellent
10778,Used to be great but now subtitles just ruined the app. Should be our choice to download subtitles or not
10779,Nice app to learn something new easily. But there are some problems because this app is not user friendly. There are not searchable block by which we can filter course but I like contents of this application everything are good there. No doubt if u learn from coursera u can easily Handel any tast for u . Thanks :-)
10780,It is more practical
10781,Thank you!
10782,"The courses are good but the app is not user friendly...there are no filters to select the preferred courses, that's a problem. Also the videos are not available in offline mode"
10783,"really Its good, but I like  to use my computer"
10784,"On trying to review a peer's assignment, it says check your internet connection and try again. My internet connection is fine and all other features of Coursera were working normally. Otherwise it's a great app and has good courses."
10785,Thank you all the professor's and the coursers team....I owe a lot to you...Keep it up
10786,Will
10787,Just took an exam and failed because the choices were not functioning.  Also wanted to access a page on the site and it timed out.  Weirdly I am taking computer technology courses.
10788,Very useful app for those who like to learn as a student.
10789,"App is just okay, the videos in the course are not downloadable, so can't be used offline. Pdf downloads are corrupted. Kindly resolve."
10790,"Excellent and perfect,however after updating I loose all downloaded materials."
10791,Just needs a search feature.
10792,"I love the offline mode, so I may watch it anytime at ease"
10793,"I like the app, but it's not functional offline, even after downloading the videos."
10794,Great
10795,Great app for a great cause
10796,Love it
10797,Confused
10798,"So many great classes to take, great website and app and streaming."

10802,Good this
10803,What they are doing for the world is nothing short of amazing!
10804,Always the best from Coursera
10805,awesome
10806,"Coursera, now to make money only"
10807,"Very good app, but lacks a sharing or ""save for later"" or wishlist  feature, which is puzzling to say the least, considering this would benefit Coursera and all of it's users on the creator side as well as the consumer side."
10808,It is an amazing app...I loved it‚ù§
10809,It's wonderful.
10810,Extremely Buggy :(
10811,Love it
10812,Haha
10813,"A very drastic downwards update since October 2016. Apps is no doubt badly built, contradict all intents and purposes of MOOC learning. Not sure it's done on purpose. It's time for Coursera to inform public of change in T&C. Even for those non subscribers, we are paying with our time for courses and your apps ranking. Time to come clean..."
10814,üëâüëè
10815,Good application
10816,Very useful .easy to use
10817,This is great app you should try it
10818,Superb
10819,Super
10820,Just started and so far i'm very pleased with both content and interface
10821,Best app for learning
10822,"You cannot get info on individual classes, just the specializations. I'm used to the pc version that allows you to get info on individually classes ."
10823,Great app
10824,Excellent classes
10825,Knowledge app
10826,Average....beginner level stuff
10827,"The app becomes unresponsive from lock screen and makes phone unresponsive. The only option is to restart the phone. Almost useless as I was planning to watch video while travelling to and from work. Don't get me wrong the courses are great, but the app needs improvements."
10828,Very very buggy
10829,Oo
10830,Great app! :-) Although the fast forward button does not work...
10831,"It used to be ""we give knowledge to people for free and make world a better place"". And now it's more like ""haha we got you! now that you are hooked on, you pay for EVERYTHING!"". Up yours you capitalist pig! I'm out for good."
10832,Great Job....
10833,"Not helping at all, why paying for the certs......"
10834,The best things in life are free...
10835,Amazing
10836,ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ÿ©
10837,It is great
10838,You provide millions of people opportunity to achieve their goals even if they are already working. This is a great way to add in your personality a new brighter layer.
10839,Awesome
10840,Could be better if i was able to see what videos i saved. And have a list of them
10841,"No more quizzes without purchasing the certificate! Unbelievable! I used to love this app and took many courses but I just tried to submit a quiz for a new course and it only allowed me to see the questions as ""preview"" and in order to submit my answers and see how I did I need to purchase the certificate for $49! That's a total rip-off! I can't believe how greedy something that used to be so good has become! I used to be able to do everything besides the official certificate and now there's no longer any excitement if I'm only allowed to ""audit"" without knowing how I'm doing. Terrible!"
10842,Much info and very useful
10843,Amazing app
10844,It would have been better if there was an option to download the videos to sd card like udemy
10845,It's very helpful and i love it so muchhh
10846,Unable to Sign in or sign up. It says network error. While all my other phone apps are working just fine on this network.
10847,"When you get an email notification that someone commented on a discussion thread you follow, the link in the email doesn't take you to that thread. It just opens Coursera app and you have to find the thread on your own."
10848,Everything costs money... I thought it was free?
10849,Excellent for study
10850,A really cool app...let's u to connect all over the globe...
10851,One of the best aps ever
10852,Crash problem
10853,I have not better product in online courses industry than coursera. Keep doing good work guys.
10854,"Two issues especially with offline viewing: 1. Saved videos for offline viewing are, in a few days, automatically deleted (don't know it it has been designed with a time clock to self delete? Pls make it clear it is). I then have to save them all again which uses my mobile data (not free!) and time. It has happened thrice. A hindrance to learning. 2. When the video is paused and played later, it doesn't continue from the last timing of the play it was left at, but it starts from the beginning. Plus it doesn't have the feature for smooth forward (soundcloud app has it even when buffering over online data lest offline). The app is user friendly though but some issues are hindering learning experience for me personally."
10855,A lovely app from an amazing MOOC site
10856,that's great.
10857,Bad
10858,Made my life easier
10859,Very nice
10860,Nice one
10861,Easy to use
10862,It would be better if you added an option to change the speed of the videos in the app (the same way it is on the video player on the website).
10863,"Best App for MOOCs, please provide a way to view and manage all offline videos."
10864,i is fine
10865,Good
10866,Nice website but app freezes my Redmi note 3 too frequently in online mode

10908,To like this app for the offline mode
10909,Could you help so that the downloaded videos have the relevant titles and not unintelligible gibberish as their filenames..

10917,It's awesome
10918,It‚Äôs an amaizing aplication for poor student to prove themsilves
10919,"Learning on the go, proving to a very good learning resource for me"
10920,"ReleaseLoggingT thread is a CPU hog when using external sdcard storage, the application became almost unusable when courses are being downloaded in the background. and it heats up the devices quickly to reach the thermal throttling point."
10921,It good app for knowledge of any course
10922,Good
10923,"Crashes and removes previously downloaded video if you quit app for a second, like for a chat"
10924,"Update : crashes Everytime I open the app.         Almost infinite courses, of which most are free but a little for certificate, which you can pay later, and deadlines so that you stay focused. This is a perfect place to learn anything."
10925,Very helpful!
10926,It says you can opt for free but I am not able enroll free as I don't need certification
10927,I like Coursera but not all my courses are working in app. I have to use browser instead app for such courses. Please fix this bug and I will put 5 start rating as you deserve.
10928,It works
10929,Best App
10930,Very usefull
10931,Still lot of things to improve
10932,Great
10933,Its awsome
10934,Very Helpful for poor students in developing countries
10935,It's an amazing job you people are doing
10936,Nice interface
10937,Useless
10938,Very useful app
10939,I started using the Android app and it is so slow and frustrating. I am not able to open few lessons which I was reading from web. Some tabs were lagging. Bad experience with Android app. But Coursera is a very good that's why gave 2 stars
10940,not optimised for Android tablets?
10941,Excellent
10942,Easy learning...works offline efficiently except for quizzes.
10943,"To be young again, to TAKE advantage of what TODAY offers; APPLYING what I learned YESTERDAY."
10944,a feature to download lectures to external SD card would be very useful
10945,"I have no problem with Coursera itself because it is very helpful and useful. My problem, however, is with the app. It has a lot of bugs that I cannot even begin to describe. It lags,   and displays error messages when I save and/or submit my homework; it displays error messages when I submit peer reviews"
10946,Free classes. College credits!! I love this app!
10947,Now the app is unusable. I can't find my courses or search for new ones.
10948,wow
10949,It would be great if you add notification üîî reminders to stay focused on courses üëç
10950,"Pertaining to quizzes that pop up in the midst of a video, many times the images do not load so it's not possible to answer those questions that rely on the images."
10951,We students are very thankful for such beautiful collection of lectures all around the world.One can go for buckets of online courses which is helpful for enhancing your skills as well as knowledge.Thanks coursesüòÉüòÉüòÉ

10956,"This is an exceptional learning tool, keep up the good work"
10957,It can't function
10958,My coursework doesn't update even though I finished them online. I find that a bit frustrating. Apart from that everything works well and app is very clean.
10959,I like this app but I am facing issues since I have installed the latest version of Coursera on Samsung E700. There is no sound in the videos for any course that I choose. My sound system is fine as it works in other applications. Kindly check into this.
10960,"Another new version, another set of bugs. Now that you charge for ""free courses"", you'd think you could afford an app that works. The autoplay for video skips the next video and jumps two ahead. I didn't even realize it for a while. At the end of the course in realized I never saw a whole bunch of videos. The titles displayed while the video is playing doesn't match the content."
10961,For courses while other apps doesn't
10962,Good
10963,This is the best app ever for learning. It's a whole university in the palm!!
10964,Great app easy to use

10969,Best
10970,Can study from my phone
10971,app crashes everytime is try to log in... Doesn't go beyond that
10972,"Very easy to use. Except that sometimes when you accidentally click on a lesson and go back to the course page without having watched the video, it shows the lesson as complete."
10973,The best educational application I had ever seen.Thanks for providing free courses.
10974,The app is great and the content is amazing. I love that it has the option to play the videos on my TV via Google Chromecast.
10975,"Very good app, if u want to really learn something then u must download it first, especially every aspiring data scientists must have this app"
10976,Only way for commoners to obtain IVY League pedagogy
10977,"An amazing app, fast, suitable and handy. Just like it."
10978,Amazing app.
10979,"I'm learning this application chines language, and many other courses that is important for personality"
10980,Amazing app
10981,That's very useful
10982,I enjoy the way the program presents the materials of the different courses.
10983,today only i knew about this site. very happy to know about all this.
10984,Good
10985,Love this app
10986,Sometimes it autoclose

10988,Awesome
10989,Big thanks to coursera for easy learning

10994,App is designed well and courses are good
10995,"Save for offline, is awesome"
10996,"It would be very helpful if there are transcripts for the videos on the app itself. Some students learn much better when reading as well as listening and, at least for me, it makes it a little easier if I could read along."
10997,Pleaee add an option to browse the vedio subtitles  as text files .
10998,"Useful, wide ,technical everything  is  for you."
10999,Brilliant!
11000,"I installed the app out of curiosity. They spammed me daily with junk emails, ads, and update notifications, until I uninstalled it."
11001,That the best app i've ever seen
11002,Good user friendly.
11003,"I love taking all this knowledge with me in my pocket. Just download and listen to in any opportunity. One note though: I would want to be able to read the transcript through the app, in a standard text format. In many cases it's easier and more beneficial than listening."
11004,Great experience in learning anywhere
11005,La App est√° bien pero no permite todas las funcionalidades de la web.
11006,Learning a lot from Universities that I can't afford.
11007,"Have taken several online courses, they're great!"
11008,Great- user friendly tools and fantastic lecturers!

11011,Really good
11012,Don't work subtitles (
11013,Perfect. Top company. Top app. Congratulations.
11014,Learning at your own pace is the way to go.
11015,"A couple issues with rotations & video playback and loading saved videos when not having Internet connectivity (subway), but IMHO these are minor issues. Psyched to see that Coursera values its Android user base with a great app. Props to the engineering team--an excellent experience and fantastic execution!!!"
11016,This app is so innovative and dynamic that I can't just stop using it.
11017,Superb
11018,"Easy to use, user friendly, informative and very good for educational purposes."
11019,"First of all, it's very tedious to download offline video fit the whole course. To make it worse, they are hidden somewhere. It's not over yet, I downloaded a whole course to watch during my travel and all the videos are either not showing the app or are somehow erased from phone's memory"
11020,I can promise that you will learn so many things.
11021,Video streaming and download is a catastrophe. Quizes crashes on submitting sometimes.
11022,sufficiently slow to mke the app unworthy.
11023,Absolutely fantastic and a great way to learn basically anything.... Free. Much of the materials used within the classrooms are from some of the best universities. A must for those seeking knowledge and wisdom.
11024,Very good
11025,Awesome
11026,Everytime it got crashed ...whenever I my internet connection is active
11027,"Great project, great app"

11051,"Good App, deliver studies on the Go!"
11052,This app isn't detecting 2MBps bandwidth on my Jio 4G network instead it downloads video at 10KBps
11053,The pictures in the quizes doesn't load about 50% of the time. It's not fun like that.
11054,Great app for self improvement
11055,so I wouldn't have to come across with foreign courses that are not spoken in English it a rly long scrolling :/

11078,Brilliant
11079,Lovely app
11080,Great app for learning.
11081,Good
11082,It's very useful and understand to HTML language and java script language thank to coursera team....
11083,It's the best gift for a student
11084,the application became almost unusable when courses are being downloaded in the background.it forces my phone to reboot several times  in android marshmallow Hauwei Nova Plus
11085,MST
11086,"An excellent conduit to access ivy league education cheaper. Assistance from the coursera  support team readily available. It is a decent platform to amass knowledge and skills , and to enhance your resume.  Loving it."
11087,App used to work perfectly. Now it does not work with my Chromecast.
11088,Contents wont load on 10mbps speed as well
11089,useful
11090,"Its very enriching, thank you for this great idea"
11091,Needs improvement
11092,"Was doing fine, but today all the courses I've tried have been stuttering, and I changed my wi-fi to check it's not caused by low bandwidth. Nexus 7 (2013) UK."
11093,Commendable app for students.
11094,This app is very useful for those who are looking for expertise in specific field.
11095,Very good and free
11096,Too good to be free
11097,One of the best app for the self learner.......
11098,It's awounderful application in learning over the Internet. I love it so much

11105,superb
11106,Excellent
11107,But contents are not enough.
11108,It is perfect  for learning
11109,"I used to really like Coursera, but I don't have the time to commit to it to make it worth $79/mo, that would have been at least 2 classes under the old model.  I work full time, have a kid so time is limited and I can only commit to one class at a time.  The program itself works fine, but unless you have time to commit full time to commit classes don't bother downloading this app."
11110,A very specialized learning app. I love it.
11111,There should be seperate section for paid and free section.
11112,"Samsung Galaxy Note -- ""Open Tool"" button does not function."
11113,It's useful app for learner
11114,I can move the app to my SD card but any download for offline viewing is stored on the phone's memory which make it pointless to have moved the app. You might not be using the KitKat API because once moved to the SD card the icon dissappear from the main screen every time I restart the phone.
11115,"Every few videos, the app would freeze but the video would keep playing with no way to stop it. Force closing the app doesn't stop the video making a reboot of the phone the only solution. The app is unusable because of that."
11116,The app is so full of bugs. They're too many to be mentioned here. And the website is down most of the time. You guys offer courses about programming and can't fix your own app and website.
11117,"I started to watch videos using my data plan, and few videos later is stopped loading, I changed to wifi connection ( several networks) and still got the message (connection problem), other than that I would give it 5 stars"
11118,I can not watch videos saved for offline while in airplane mode. How could you not test this crucial functionality??
11119,So educative app i ever use this whole time tho üòéüòé
11120,"I really want to like this application, but the mobile developer is still not ready for prime time. The application has become better, but still doesn't feel mature. I spent a long time downloading the videos at home so I could watch them offline, but a recent update deleted ALL the videos."
11121,The tool through which you complete assignments does not open at all!!!
11122,This is the best app for online educatio. Reliable and easy! It has many more to offer. I strogly recommend this to all.
11123,Its a great platform to learn and get updated and also time saving and convenient.I love it
11124,Simplified
11125,A place where you can spread your wings and fly in a world of knowledge.

11132,Very useful
11133,I'm trying to download it but an error occurs again and again help me out in downloading this app
11134,Its such an awesome app for taking a course and learning new stuff. The entire structure is easy and intuitive to follow and every feature of the app works smoothly towards one goal -  keeping you on track and focused about your learning.
11135,Its an  excellent way to learn.
11136,Nice
11137,Really useful. Thanks for enabling those courses for people all around the world from top schools
11138,Good one..
11139,Video speed is not changing. This hiders my learning rate. The downloading feature is nice though.
11140,Excellent app to learn...!
11141,Good
11142,Its not free as u describe..most of it u have to pay
11143,Just that but I love it
11144,"The app fails to download - always shows the status as ""pending download"". I have tried several times in the past one week."
11145,But finally we got any course completion certificate ?
11146,"Many times I start the app , the mobile restarted, especially when download"
11147,Thank you for making quality education available in this way!
11148,"Coursera, the best ever..."
11149,Very useful app

11151,The door opens the horizon of knowledge.
11152,I think it is very helpful for everyone.. Let's get benefit from it
11153,Awesome
11154,"The app hangs quite often on my phone.( Redmi Note 3,  lollipop)"
11155,Cannot navigate to home screen with all my courses

11165,App
11166,"The interface is user-friendly and makes sense, and offline mode is perfect especially if you like to study courses on a plane."
11167,Well made app
11168,"When I watch a lecture, independently on the value I select for video speed (2.0x or 1.5x)tje video plays always at 1.0x speed. This is a very bothersome bug!"
11169,Gets you engaged and focused. I love coursera app.
11170,"Not responding in subways, when I need it the most."
11171,You have to pay for everything I want and nothing else good
11172,"One issue I've noticed is that, for some reason, the Coursera App does not show up on the list of active apps on my Asus Zenfone 2, running Android 4.4.2. Other than that, it has allowed me to carry on with my course while away from the desktop."
11173,Thanks a lot for helping many people to study
11174,It's amazing.
11175,Still have to take it for a ride
11176,"When I open the app and play a video, suddenly the app crashes but the audio will continue in the background. I tried to close the app, did a force stop and even cleared the app cache and whole data but still the audio plays in the background. Finally I had to restart my mobile to stop the audio..  Please solve this issue.. I'm not able to complete my courses on time.. This is happening a lot recently."
11177,Amazing app with amazing courses.
11178,"Please add functionality for variable speed playback, or at least save the downloads in a public directory."
11179,An amazing educational tool
11180,"Currently, I love this app. It gives you the ability to learn anything you want for free online, but the only drawback that I've experienced is how I am unable to submit my answers at the end of the test. It always replaces my input with a couple of lines of code, and says I got the answer wrong, even though it was the answer I submitted."
11181,It is not free
11182,Online courses
11183,Is the certificate valid in India???
11184,For ever downloading even on android device !!!myb its the handset am using

11189,It's use full
11190,This site includes many useful course in most of seintific subject
11191,It would be better if there is a way to take and save notes in the app.
11192,The best to educate online from the world universities More than college
11193,Essential
11194,Vibrant courses and had freedom to choose anything.Great work and Very thankful to the team
11195,"Crashes frequently, forces re downloads, hard to use offline because it's so buggy."
11196,"In quiz screen, you guys are possibly adding views (or data to recyclerview/ListView) in onResume(), so everytime I press home button then reopen the app, the content of the screen gets doubled. This is a big app which shouldn't have this trivial kind of bugs."
11197,"The app takes ages to cast to Chromecast and it only casts audio, not video...."
11198,"The casting function would work better. I often only get audio if it works, which it does not on occasion. Please fix this. I use a note 5 with the latest chromecast on a 802.11 n wifi network."

11223,If your in need of good career and education results COURSERA is your home.
11224,"It would be great if new users will have the opportunity sign up through the app, but something is broken there. It does not work. The app is asking  password on signing up and when I am trying input it's notifying me that the pass is wrong. Fix it, please."
11225,Best learning platform for students
11226,It's best opportunity to learn at your pace of time and distance
11227,The best
11228,After installing I logged in its shows this app can't work so many times I tried.
11229,what about portuguese?
11230,Flawless in its new version
11231,Can't even sign up
11232,Each course asking for around 25000 ‚Çπ ....
11233,Unable to download the video
11234,YOU CHANGED MYLIFE
11235,As a android  user must google+ signing option.
11236,Good app
11237,"The coursera app is a great companion for the courses online, to the extent that you can actually do the whole course on it. One of the most important features to me id that you can listen to the course while your screen is blocked. This has allowed me to listen to the course while driving or walking down the street."
11238,Good app and cources
11239,Great app and idea but too many bugs
11240,I can't able to log in.
11241,Shittiest app.Learn from Udacity about efficient app designing.
11242,This app allows to access video tutorials from the world's best University teachers. I love it.
11243,"Network errors everywhere. In app, in logout, after reinstalling fails to sign in. And web is OK. And network is OK. Sigh"
11244,Amazing
11245,superb
11246,Yet again some failed new update... Now I can't download course videos any more.
11247,"Great fan of coursera content. I bought many courses and it helped me a lot. But would like to see the app not glitch, not buggy. I still don't get the point behind verification...  Anyone can reply!"
11248,"I don't know why, but lately I fart a lot."
11249,I tried taking the quiz for Geoff Hintons course on neural networks. It had lot of mathematical notations but app failed to render.
11250,Interesting
11251,... When are you going to make a tablet version?
11252,"I love coursera, but this review is about the app. It works great, but the Chromecast streaming is still an issue. You can see the progress bar in the tv loading and when is about to finish buffering it then resets and starts over. Then it becomes an infinite loop."
11253,Doesn't update my account details and courses. Shows old data. Crashes. Sometimes I have to kill app and restart to get updated data.
11254,"The more you unsuscribe from e-mails,  the more e-mails you get."
11255,"Why does this app need so many permissions? Why contacts, phone identity, Wi-Fi state, and the rest? The authentication even for verified certificates does not need them."
11256,Was expecting a stable and high quality but so far its disappointingly unstable.
11257,I loved it. It's the reason behind my new professional career. Thanks Coursera.
11258,Good app
11259,"Please add the functionality of the media player of the website, eg. speed control."
11260,Loved it
11261,You can even download video and watch it offline :)
11262,Chromecast seems to be completely broken now.
11263,Best app. I can learn from any domain. Also the features are very good.
11264,The app hangs frequently!
11265,It is the best app to learn courses
11266,Just need an update that in app while opening the review your peer work the app is not able to perform the task. Please fix the bug.
11267,I'm just loving it through and through. On my third course now and getting an education for a lifetime.
11268,Excellent
11269,There is no way to find out which courses/parts of courses have been downloaded. Because of this offline and new courses get mixed up and we lose them.
11270,If you wanna learn is your app
11271,"You have to pay at least $49 to see your results from quizzes? I went into it thinking that you just had to pay for a certificate, but no. You can ONLY view the videos for free. I wish I'd had known that BEFORE I invested the time into it."
11272,Can't increase video speed on tablets versions please add this feature üòä
11273,This app charges way too much for the courses they offer there are other apps that provide this info for free!!!!!
11274,"I'm using this educational WEBSITE for years and it's simply GREAT! So, I would request to the developers to make the efficient changes to make it the best educational APP as well... :)"
11275,This app works perfectly fine for me. It's definitely a 5 star rating.
11276,I am very satisfied with the app . Whenever I stroll or do home chores I enjoy following an online course.
11277,Good app but struggles when used with a chromecast. Casting takes ages to start or simply fails. Quizzes during the video are not handled gracefully when casting.
11278,"Great course content, poor app. Chromecast support is utterly broken."
11279,"This Application is very good for me,awesome"
11280,App hangs or never begins playing videos
11281,Ghood
11282,Offers one of the best online courses
11283,Nice
11284,Chemistry
11285,Nice app. It encourages learni
11286,All happening on its good possible way!
11287,Very useful
11288,Gives network error! I can browse and use other apps just fine
11289,Helpful tool to progress
11290,You can take the course free or choose to pay a fee and get the certificate.
11291,"I use Chromecast to watch course videos.  There is about a 10‚ÑÖ chance it works correctly.  Usually the app crashes, it doesn't start, or the video doesn't show."
11292,"I enjoy working with this website/application. I have taken only two free courses so far and signed up for few more. Very informative, wells organized, and motivating! Thank you for this world wide access."
11293,The app is a full of bugs and crashes often. Really grateful to the team behind for providing free lessons. Thanks.
11294,Very useful
11295,I found when running the videos via Chromecast the video is delayed to play or it causes the app to crash
11296,Me encantan estos cursos son una buena opcion para los que queremos seguir aprendiendo.
11297,It's an amazing app for a person like me in Nepal to learn from world class universities.
11298,It is really a good app for aspirants
11299,Loving it
11300,A good app for online courses

11302,Love it!
11303,"Since this application is on Google play, why can't we make payments to various universities via our network service providers instead of limiting it to credit cards? I would really want to do a number of mouth watering courses but I don't have credit card facilities, neither does my bank allow online payments outside the country. Hence I do my payments to various apps via my Telecom Mobile operator (through airtime). And that's very convenient."
11304,Hopefully the video player can have speed multiplier :)
11305,Excellent
11306,I like the courses.
11307,Everything cost money!
11308,One of the main reason I downloaded the app was for a better mobile experience however I have to keep going back to the website due to non-functional Chromecast support so I don't much see the point.
11309,The app crashes! Cant get into the courses!
11310,Awesome
11311,The app itself is good anyway it's far from perfect. However I give them 5 stars because they provide the best MOOCS's I've ever attended.
11312,Great app
11313,Superb MOOC
11314,"Useful ,fast and easy to use Edu pro."
11315,Concepts at our fingertips!!
11316,Ugh. I'm not paying just to be able to not participate in assignments so this app is being deleted. 0 stars if I could
11317,Useful
11318,"Interface is good but I have to save the same videos over and over again, I am not clearing app data and it still happens"
11319,Nice ap
11320,"Coursera is not free any more, all courses ask to pay money."
11321,Education at my finger tips
11322,"I started a music theory course and its very good, except that it keeps asking me questions with a photo example that never loads so it's impossible to answer the question! Quite frustrating."
11323,The best user experience
11324,Highly recommended.
11325,It's very useful app. .and we learn simply in it. .
11326,"Awesome , I learn here what I want ."

11328,Awesome App
11329,it would be good if there are settings to set the video speed as present in normal website.. pls add it..
11330,Enrolling in classes has become easier but still runs into cumbersome tasks when reviewing individual courses under specialisations.
11331,"I first overlook it, but it is the best."
11332,It is quiet easy to use with the latest offline feature which helps to learn lot of things on the go. Educational content is Very good.
11333,Please provide the video speed control option... pleeeeease....this wl then b the best app ever...pleeeeease try to add it in update
11334,"The app does everything I'd want it to do and with a good user experience, but there are so many bugs! It crashes and locks up my entire phone regularly."
11335,The courses provided is Excellent.Nice Idea of Online and Offline Education.Thanks......
11336,"I found that I enrolled the The Principle of Finance which hold by Michigan University. I am in Module 4: Company and Project valuation. When I enter the forum through the app, the app doesn't  appearance any thread. Could develop team check again this error?"
11337,"Love this app. Works flawlessly, wonderful concept that is full of useful information. App works well no complaints"
11338,Thanks coursera for access to such awesome video lectures
11339,"Smooth and simple UI, let's you take courses and simplify your experience, I like that because you don't waste your time."
11340,i like coursera but the app needs to improve the quality of videos!!!
11341,Hi my name is Abdirahman from Somalia this awesome application
11342,Learning never stops.
11343,Please fix! Super annoying to not be able to pause.
11344,High quality tutorials with mazing interface !
11345,With this app learned a lot of lessons and I strongly recommend this for all those who wanna study at home this is very good.
11346,Very good
11347,Wow
11348,This is an incredible way to increase  your knowledge or learn a new subject. Teachers are awesome I'm learning a lot.
11349,Infinite loading after update.
11350,Huge blast
11351,Very interesting! !!
11352,"Video playback is nice, but can't take quizzes because questions never load (even with a GREAT Internet connection)..."
11353,Very good
11354,Sexy
11355,I cannot hear the voice when I play
11356,The Chromecast feature doesn't work.
11357,Very Nice
11358,Videos that are saved offline have names that does not make any sense. I want to watch the saved videos on my laptop. How can convert those random names so that they make sense..please help!! Have two complete courses saved on my phone and my phone broke down!
11359,It would be great if you include a wishlist tab so that we can refer to that course later and don't have to search for the course again... While browsing I find some awesome course but there is no option to save or tag to the favourites so that I can enroll the course later...
11360,"On phone, the most I can get from an app is go through discussion and save time at laptop for watching videos, taking notes, and doing assigenments. But discussion forums are not included !!! So The App is useless in my case"
11361,Saved my life
11362,"It's a great though of a good people. Which are trying to build a new era of learning of new things. It's useful for everyone , & easy to use ."
11363,Awesome
11364,"I spend a lot of my times offline downloading videos for offline use, after download multiple videos i lost my access to the tablet. Screen gets off, no poweroff no shutdown, no turn on screen, nothing for at least 1 or 2 hours. I didn't experienced this before, but I have it now with cousera app. Coursera is awesome, I am just not happy with the app. No problem in watching video online using the app. Thanks"
11365,I love it
11366,It helpd me alot in my study.
11367,I m loving in it
11368,"Some classes I was unable to enroll in on the app, so I had to go on computer to enroll, which was inconvenient."
11369,Free course online keep it up
11370,Very good to my need
11371,Thank you guys
11372,Free courses
11373,"Cool app design. I have trouble downloading videos to SD card. When I switch to secondary it only 'download' the assignment or readings, but not videos"
11374,Like it very much
11375,I love coursera but was unable to open individual course pages hence can't use the app. Improve it.
11376,Alwys grt
11377,"Bring back the old courses, please!"
11378,Marvellous Application ‚ò∫
11379,But this is one of the most jaw dropping apps I have ever seen i will get a credit card just to try this omg I'm stunned
11380,Want to be able to use it on tableton the go but it does not offer sign in with Facebook. Please advise!
11381,Great app
11382,very useful.
11383,Simply beautiful
11384,Nice App
11385,Love Coursera my app goes on my phone fast! AND MY TABLET TO:)
11386,It works perfectly well for me
11387,Fantastic app
11388,Nice app
11389,Complementary for professionals!
11390,Best MOOC with plenty of  short span courses.
11391,Loved it
11392,The free features help a lot of us who weren't very financially privileged in our times to complete our education.
11393,Nice ..but.video...not download
11394,Nice. App
11395,Offering free courses is no joke. This is a pure example of technology used in the right way!
11396,I am feeling pros are lecturing here even good than the mit open courseware
11397,"Well the courses are excellent, but it could be better if there could be other alternative payment gateways like paytm, freecharge etc. Kindly see to it."
11398,I can become a pro reading this stuff!!! Crazy and useful app
11399,"First of all I want to say that I like Coursera and I like it's platform. But this mobile app has several bugs to solve: 1-. Even if you download the videos, you are unable to play them without conexion (when you play one of the videos, it keeps loading until infinite). 2-. When trying to review a peer to peer work, it is unable to load text correctly and it starts to flash the text. But I am unable to read it this way. I hope thay they solve this soon because I really like the course that I'm doing."
11400,"Courses in all fields and mostly for free, recommend it for every one."
11401,Gud 4 learnin
11402,"Nice app, only problem is if i get a call in middle of video, video does not paus"
11403,Many course s in apps are paid but i want to watch . why cant you make them free
11404,App accepted payment but certificate was not given. Sent feedback but no reply.
11405,Use full.
11406,Nice to meet this application
11407,"I usually download the videos whenever I am connected to a wifi. Unfortunately, when it is about time to watch the videos, they always get lost, and the app prompts me to download the videos again. Other than this, this is a good app."
11408,The app is useful to review lesson and learn something new. I really appreciate!
11409,I think it's a perfect app
11410,"Good content but the organization of the app can be better. The layout seems very messy and it's not easy for me to keep track of my courses.   For tablets:  The playback speed selection is not available for tablets, which is very disappointing. The text size on the course description and notes sections can't be adjusted also, and it's difficult to read the small texts from a tablet. Missing the whole point of tablets being bigger devices for bigger displaying."
11411,Great Idea
11412,Practical app
11413,Mast ahe app
11414,Thanks for all
11415,I have been using it from last 4 months. The improvements are noticeable and its dashboard look is awesome
11416,I've enrolled in a course and used this app thoroughly. Mighty impressed with the delivery mechanism and UI.
11417,"I like the app, it clearly outlines courses available to me; however, it would be even better if there was a facility that would let me 'bookmark' courses that interest me and I may like to take at some point in the future."
11418,"The app force close as soon as I try to ""Verify"""
11419,"The UI is nice and I love that I can take quizzes easily on it. But the video playback speed changing is broken for me. It worked briefly when I first started using the app, but hasn't worked for the past few updates. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still wouldn't work. And I don't even have the option to change the speed on my tablet. This means that I still have to use a browser to progress at a speed I find reasonable. Phone is a OnePlus One, Android 6.0.1, Cyanogen OS 13.1.2"
11420,This is a great app for learning for learning. This experience have been amazing ever since I started using it. Please I don't seem to know where to view my feedbacks both in app and on the mobile site. Help?
11421,It forces closed
11422,Super
11423,Online courses
11424,Learning on the go! I procured 2 certificates.. But now no course is offered free. So moved to edx.
11425,Cruise through Courses as per your liking.... Very very impressive courses design n content! Future of education! Get the best in the world from anywhere in the world
11426,It is best educational app in the wors
11427,"Never been able to download.. not even one video at a time, pauses automatically saying waiting for wifi.. even when it's OK."
11428,Ê£í
11429,G8
11430,"Very useful, you can do your test here"
11431,In-lecture quiz is finally implemented! Now it's better than Web as the app also has offline mode.
11432,"Good app, but would like to be able to bookmark courses for later viewing/enrolling. The best way to do this I found is to save the courses straight to Evernote from the app"
11433,Great app. Thank you Coursera for making knowledge available and accessable.
11434,Awesome
11435,"In verify, take photo, app keeps crashing"
11436,My HTC one m9 crashes every time I run this app
11437,Hangs out lot
11438,Nice
11439,I loved this app so much because I can learn anytime anywhere using this awesome app.
11440,Loved it
11441,Rather spartan and unatractive. Doesn't catch the eye / contribute to a pleasant learning experience.
11442,Great app
11443,The app keeps loading forever and crashes quite often. The learning experience is very bad. I would recommend chalkstreet. They have good learning experience and offline download option as well. The content is well structured too. I don't think so coursera bothers about enhancing the app experience. Please fix the app ASAP.
11444,"The app is good, and user friendly, except the fact that I've used to hang up often in my old phone, but I am not holding against it. Keep up the good work"
11445,Super app super contents
11446,It'S VERY NICE.
11447,Super
11448,Great way to explore‚Ä¶
11449,It does not work smoothly.. But courses are great..
11450,"Assignment submission is possible. But there is no editing options like bold, italics, etc."
11451,A good course well presented in a hassle free app.
11452,Lovely
11453,Love it. Its the best
11454,"The app does not validate the email. No matter how many times you unsubscribe, you'll receive more emails"
11455,Good app-  it makes thing easier
11456,Keeps crashing on my nexus 5x
11457,"I can't speed up the video, and it's painful to watch any course at such low speeds. Other than that, the content is amazing, and worth the download."
11458,Improve your skills ppl. There is nothing else like this.
11459,"The app lets you browse and join courses, watch videos, save them for offline access and take quizzes. HOWEVER you end up having to log-in for discussion forums and peer graded assignments. Kindly consider adding these features in app to make it a standalone solution and not a complementary offering. +1 star if in-app discussion forums added."
11460,Useful and handy app for mobile users instead of desktop PC or laptop.
11461,I want to learn german but there  is no such courses on coursera . Please add more language courses
11462,1 word. Dope.
11463,First time I am use this but I see now how this work
11464,Wants me to sign up before I can even look at the courses to decide if I want to try one.
11465,Please add features mobile notification/calendar about assignments
11466,Hgdc Jeff if eh I hgty
11467,Great app
11468,"If you are making an app or a website for that matter, it has to be quick. It cannot be so slow that the person feels bored and closes the app. This goes for both your website and ur app. YouTube vids can load quickly. But coursera videos. No. They just won't"
11469,Huge source of knowledge about uncommon subjects. It would be great if more courses are free. Some courses are very basic which takes in a lot of time to move to the main subject as all of them are mandatory. Coursera has helped me a lot in my professional career.
11470,I love the app
11471,Certifications are too expensive
11472,"Only reason I have the app is so I can verify my quiz results for a certificate ... the feature doesn't work.  Please fix this, and I will reconsider my rating.  Coursera Support Case #1225804"
11473,Superb
11474,Links are great on this site
11475,Excellent learning features
11476,For continuing education .u have to get it
11477,Dark theme pleaseeeee
11478,Its all about educating people. We all should work towards making this knowledge of ocean free...
11479,It is a great app for the learners..gives a variety of subjects ..and learning through this is too simple..
11480,Great learning opportunity
11481,"Amazingly eficient, doesn't pollute you with notifications (like duolingo), with OFFLINE MODE. Overall useful"
11482,Offline mode is good but need to be able to save data to SD card.
11483,I don't know how but the offline videos get deleted automatically. I have to keep downloading same videos again and again!!
11484,It's easy to use and easy to get into the course directly. Courses available are really cool.
11485,ur contributions are great to this world
11486,Very usefull and very designed
11487,I've used this app to study at home I  coffee shops and basically anywhere there is WiFi!
11488,No way to get new password after forgotten. Such a low grade mistake!
11489,Great courses from great people
11490,"You can't enrol single course. Also, the courses are very basic and short. It is about only 5-10%,of real university courses. If I pay for something, I want to obtain full course, not short version."
11491,Just love it
11492,Normal
11493,"Brilliant app. Now I can watch my favourite lectures anywhere, anytime."
11494,Very smart
11495,"I love coursera ,but the Android mobile version just stopped working a weeks ago and it seems like coursera isnt working on that. I just cant watch any course offline because it always says ""Error reading subtitles file....."" .ive seen lots of people complain about it"
11496,I have gained enormous skills from courses offered on Coursera
11497,App crashes when I try to take a photo for assignment verification.
11498,Great content. However offline videos feature is not working.
11499,Yay!
11500,I've immensely benefited from this educational tool.
11501,Used to be good but now have to pay to see the scores of the course quiz. I don't want a certificate but do want to know if I'm getting the questions right. ¬£37 is a lot just for quiz results. Uninstalling as pointless if I can't see if I'm actually learning anything.
11502,Great apps..
11503,Great app
11504,We cn easily utilize our time n we cn easily learn so mny thng through dis app.
11505,That is cool.
11506,I have a problem on peer review assignments plz fix it.
11507,Very useful for the keen leaner.
11508,Awesome... great hub to learn something new.
11509,Worst app I have ever seen.
11510,Awesome
11511,"Freezes on Xiaomi note 3 pro, but in general, OK"
11512,Love this app!!
11513,Easy to find courses.
11514,Intresting but too expensive especially for where im from
11515,Sir salute
11516,It was very useful to me
11517,I dont know how to explain the perfectness of this app.sometimes i think of not going to university and studying at home with this app.
11518,Awsm easy download easy access to each course...  Love it...
11519,I love the app and it is great for videos and for downloading so I can listen on the bus. Sometime I just want to read the material and I cannot access the transcripts on the app. I have to go to the mobile site which is very annoying.
11520,Interesting...
11521,Pls give solution for not streaming or downloading videos. It shows error everytime that wifi error. You need to resolve this problem as your every user complaining abbout this.
11522,It needs improvement in user navigation. For some features it requires to use browser which is frustrating
11523,Good app for learning
11524,Make the size of the icon small..it's as huge as my screen
11525,It helped a lot really
11526,üîúüîùüí™üíô
11527,Great app. Lots of interesting courses and ability to learn offline. However after the latest patch the photo verification crashes the app. Very inconvenient!
11528,Very useful app.
11529,"Useful , important"
11530,Ocean of wisdom
11531,Saved video is not playing on galaxy s7 edge.
11532,I do not sign up for accounts with apps before I try them.
11533,excellent. effort by the makers to connect the students all around the whole .
11534,Im 12 and my teacher showed me this on a computer and im really looking forward to doing this
11535,"It would be a five star if it could give me the transcripts to read on my tablet etc. But overall, brilliant."
11536,Very fluent app and needless to say such a great initiative.
11537,So bad
11538,Add some courses in Hindi language
11539,"Videos once saved as offline doesn't play, what's the point of saving then? Hope you resolve it in coming updates.                                                            Edit : Okay it doesn't work saving videos on sd card, maybe restricted rights or something, working fine while saving on phone memory."
11540,Most efficient
11541,I can't put the value of Coursera in words
11542,A great way available for self learning in generally inaccessible fields
11543,Audio is moving faster than the video.
11544,"Sometimes ""Saving for Offline"" usage doesn't work."
11545,Excellent app interface and more courses available to improve our skills and knowledge.
11546,"Also needs to incorporate the peer assessed assignments. Besides that and the crashing regularly, love it dearly"
11547,"After download,  reopen app, will lost connection with just downloaded video, Can not find downloaded video"
11548,A good way to step into online education
11549,I used this app to learn Python programming and i mastered it in 3 months :)
11550,"The app was ok. You could download the lectures but some of the features are not available for mobile so you still need a computer etc to do everything.  The big issue came with the last update: now whenever I open the app, all I get is a blank screen. I just uninstalled and reinstalled but if it doesnt work I wont bother anymorel. Sadly, since coursera changed platform (and has increasingly become more pay-per access oriented) the course quality has gone down."
11551,Excellent
11552,amazing App
11553,It's a great app with good content. One option which the app need is the option to see saved courses/prioritize the course I have enrolled for rather than going through all course I have enrolled to find the course I'm attending at the moment.
11554,This app provide more information and knowledge for the students
11555,A great place to learn
11556,Good app
11557,I love it
11558,Free education. What's not to like?
11559,Important tool to enhance career
11560,"The app itself is amazing, interface is great. Lectures get downloaded fast. But. It takes forever to load."
11561,Thanks Andrew for creating such an amazing platform for learning.
11562,Top learning App
11563,"It's a great app whenever it works. However, it saves the videos on the phone even if SD card is selected. Even more frustrating is that it doesn't load or play saved videos offline and keeps crashing."
11564,Answers for assessment disappear and application navigates back when rotating screen being on assessment screen. Assessments are just not shown after navigating to them in landscape mode. These bugs appear at least in Algorithms Part I course by Sedgewick & Wayne.
11565,Best Ever app
11566,"Please offer a paid version that has minimal permissions, as the requested permissions for this 'free' app are ridiculous. There's not even an attempt to justify them in the description."
11567,Estou o utilizando com o Google chromecast e estou super satisfeito com suas funcionalidades.
11568,"Before Android 6 I always hadp to kill the process in order to load the app. It was always slow in loading, which is annoying, because I simply want to see downloaded video. Now since Android 6 it stopped to work at all. Looking forward for an update to keep learning.."
11569,Doesn't allow to download videos in SD card. Doesn't support auto rotate.
11570,I have been using it for quite some time and very often when I open the app it justs shows a blank white screen which is very annoying. There are a few other bugs also like this. I hope it is resolved soon. It is an useful app though(when it works fine).
11571,Great learning platform
11572,Loved it. Great app.
11573,Itll be great to have the discussions sync with the online forums.
11574,"Feels smooth and has all features I need. The only missing feature for me is video speed adjustments (available on the web), and the only bug I've encountered is that when my phone's screen turns off while casting course videos (as expected), when in-video questions need to pop, they don't. I need to keep waking it to ensure questions are not lost. Excellent app in all other aspects."
11575,Really loved it
11576,"I downloaded the app because it came up when I searched 'Learn Spanish Offline' in Google Play Store. I was therefore surprised that it does not offer Spanish courses. In general the app looks good, useful and one I could keep if you would please introduce a Spanish course , preferably Level A1/A2"
11577,Best way to in rich knowledge
11578,Saying a big thank you to the creators of coursera. Coursera is arguably one of the best things to happen to online learning and enlightenment. Scholarly education is now right in the palm of our hands. Well done Coursera.
11579,One f d Best app.. Made d toughest thing to me so easy and understandable.
11580,Good MOOC app
11581,Nice
11582,I can't see the possible answers while taking the quiz. Done images just aren't loading.
11583,Really a good job but make it a lite app
11584,jst love it
11585,Loving the concept
11586,"The pictures on quizzes don't load, verification almost never happens. The desktop version is better, don't ever try to go app only with this product."
11587,It's motivating
11588,Not working on my huawei g730 running on android 4.2.2
11589,This app is really good
11590,This is the best application for learn
11591,Great
11592,Good site and courses
11593,Can't post either
11594,Overall OK app and syncs well with the server. App doesn't play offline downloaded videos without an internet connection or does it randomly.
11595,Work hard
11596,"Good, yet room for improvement."
11597,Love it
11598,Unfortunately the offline mode still not working after so many updates or patches. Rather disappointed.
11599,Coursera is great service for learning!  But mobile app missing one important feature - you can't speed up video (you can do it using site).  Please add video speed-up!
11600,The Best
11601,Why do you need wireless info? Why do you need identity? Why do you need to reach photos?
11602,Awesome
11603,Courses are rather basic and not from top universities. The app is crap and doesn't load most of the courses.
11604,Really so much helpful
11605,I gave 5 stars. but the new versions don't works. he alway ask to login again and I can't use off line. please fix it. Fixed now I gave 5 stars
11606,I have alway wanted 2 broaden my horizon. Coursera has made it possible 4 me. Thanks guys. Keep up the good work.
11607,Photo verification crashes the app on Android N on Nexus 6p !
11608,Downloaded videos do not play
11609,Profusely
11610,Lectures are good
11611,I Like and thanks for are all creating this App
11612,"U gotta try it, it simply perfect."
11613,What a incredible app
11614,"Now with this application I can continue studying my Coursera courses on the go, even when I'm offline, it provides everything I need for learning, I really appreciate it. And I strongly recommend this to everyone who takes online training serious."
11615,Great App
11616,App doesn't load at times. Shows white screen and stops responding.
11617,"You can't view comments on the questions in the forums or reply on them, it's a major bug i hope you solve it early"
11618,Not free anymore!!
11619,But doesn't work fluently.
11620,Very useful
11621,Courses
11622,Good
11623,Great free course app!
11624,"It so useful app,  I  like it so much."
11625,I've already taken some course here and really helps me to learn at my own pace.
11626,Learning as much as I canüòÅ
11627,Very slow app. Crashes often. Has tons of bugs. Please add the feature for changing the playback speed of a video. Also it would be better if this app was a foreground app instead of running in the background all the time
11628,Aced some subjects . Really helpful.
11629,Constantly crashes
11630,Loved app to get certifications
11631,"Cannot set video playback speed anymore, has trouble switching between portrait and landscape mode. [EDIT] it looks it was fixed with the latest update. Also the offline mode seems more reliable. I would appreciate more informative changelogs."
11632,Learning while travelling by bus to office... Sometimes I hope to get stuck in traffic so that the lecture gets over :)
11633,Awesome !!
11634,k
11635,"The lectures and courses are good. However, the offline mode does not work. I can download lectures but when I try to watch them it still tries to stream them. If I use a file explorer I can find the downloaded videos but the titles are not human readable. The app also does not save videos to my SD card. It gives that option but still saves to local memory. If the app played the downloaded videos when offline i would up to 5 stars."
11636,"The coursers app itself is generally easy to use, but it is very frustrating to search for a course and see there are 100's of similar courses related to your search only to find that most of these matches are either in a language you don't speak or are in fact not related to what you're after. It'd be good to at least be able to filter out for your native language instead of having to trawl through the many unhelpful results in Spanish/Chinese or whatever else the courses are listed in."
11637,"After giving more than sufficient time to start the playback, it keeps on buffering and the video never starts. And after sometime the app stops working and OS suggest to force stop it."
11638,Best mooc app.
11639,Do advise why u need to read our data and other 5 such private data. Can we trust it not to be hacked?
11640,Love it...Done with my latest course...Thanks...This new update works faster than the last one....üëçüëç
11641,Yeah it deserves
11642,Great app for learning
11643,"Big thanks to whole team behind this wonderful platform, You guys are helping alot of people in this world in pursue of their dream career."
11644,Very useful for those who enjoy self education :)
11645,This is the best online course!
11646,I think it will increase our power of knowledge
11647,Just love it
11648,"I've used this app at early stages and thought what a great world we live in now,  everyone has an opportunity to access learning materials that they may not have access to due to economic,  geographic,  or other reasons. Back then it was free,  and I've enrolled to a filmmaking course,  which was rather useful to expand my horizon. I didn't use the app for a long time,  and tonight when I wanted to check if there is any digital marketing course,  to my disappointment there were few,  but now all for ¬£360."
11649,"The very first time I saw this app I felt glad!%                                                                      education is at our door steps,we learn in or home.I learn in my bed everyday watching my new coursera courses videos.it's interesting for me."
11650,"The very first time I saw this app I felt glad!%                                                                      education is at our door steps,we learn in or home.I learn in my bed everyday watching my new coursera courses videos.it's interesting for me."
11651,This was a great app  it after recent update it won't open Have tried reinstalling That sorted for a while but gone wrong again Will try unintelligible again
11652,"I'm currently pursuing Politics and Economics of International Energy, and I couldn't be more satisfied! Great range of courses offered from different universities of the world. With the app studying becomes more mobile! Great going guys.. Keep up the good work!"
11653,"I was reluctant to leave a review about an update that broke the app (can't get past empty white screen), but now that it's gone nearly two weeks without being corrected and emails to tech support have gone unanswered I think it's warranted."
11654,"Sometimes, when I get bored, I go to my backyard, cover myself in earth and pretend to be a carrot üòçüòò"
11655,"The app is definitely easy to use. Watching lecture videos on the go, attempting quiz etc. is easy. Some expected features: (1) Final project submissions and/or peer review (2) ""Wishlist"" feature (adding courses to look at later) or ""recently viewed"", both in the app & desktop site (3) Separate tab or quicker access to university pages within Coursera, to check list of all courses offered by them."
11656,Most of the videos either do not play or are mute.
11657,Wondrful
11658,Guud
11659,Used to be a great app. Since the last update it fails to play downloaded lectures on galaxy tab 10. This makes it useless for me. Would greatly appreciate a fix.
11660,App is not working on my LG G4. Very dissatisfied
11661,"this app needs a filter to search for and find courses easier. It needs the ability to filter courses by price, subject, institution and difficulty level as well as language. Edx is a much better app for learning because of this."
11662,Offline mode makes it perfect
11663,Nice
11664,This is best
11665,Even with multiple updates the downloading videos bug still remain. The function works with the default storage selected but it doesn't with the SD storage selected. Please fix it for five stars.
11666,You have to pay to see how u did in a quiz. That makes no sense. I'll give 5 stars of I don't have to pay to see how I did.
11667,Coursera is a great platform. Taking full advantage of the resources provided. Thanks to all who have contributed!
11668,I really like the app since the beginning but it's all about Science if you guys improve Arts & Humanities i'll hit 5*.
11669,Amazingly enriching
11670,Os melhores cursos do mundo na palma da sua m√£o!
11671,I liked it very much~ how we can learn from the top Universities in the world

11673,I cant reply to my own threads in the discussion forum
11674,"It's a great app, take learning in your pocket..."
11675,I love this app. But is there a way to buffer videos in lower quality?
11676,"All the videos in all courses don't run in my device .. It says ""Oops...."
11677,"App freezes, doesn't show enrolled courses even when net or other apps work just fine. After taking screenshot of a clip by pausing it, app started taking literally infinite time to start."
11678,That's exciting learn online via coursera
11679,It does not show up in the running apps list (especially when the app is running). Nor is it present in the list of the latest apps. What on earth?? Also - it's lagging and VERY slow to start up
11680,Online
11681,Can't add postings to discussion topics. Send button doesn't work.
11682,Best App for passionate learners.üòÉ
11683,"The app says separate courses can be taken for free by clicking on them, but none of that works, the only link that does work is the payment page..."
11684,Recommended.
11685,Learning.......
11686,Wonderful App.
11687,It would be amazing if i get to know how to get courses for free  .can anyone tell me plz??
11688,"Nothing happens, no progress indication and no error message."
11689,Awesome!
11690,Awesome App
11691,Love it
11692,The video keeps buffering even with a 20mbps connection
11693,Can't find course pages to audit a course for free
11694,Best app
11695,"I just loved it, and its always like ""Whaooo"""
11696,"One issue I have is that whenever I press the home button and minimize the app,  and then open the recent apps menu, I can't find the coursera icon at all!  But when I click the icon in the app drawer, everything is just as I left it. Weird.. Don't know why this is happening,   I'm on Android 4.4 kitkat.  Please fix this bug. Thanks!"
11697,This app is not useful for all people in the world. They think that learning is not good for third world people. It's a kind of racism.
11698,Thank you for making this website and app. It helped me alot! Keep up the good work!!
11699,Very useful learning app!
11700,Very very useful
11701,Loved it....
11702,"I have really enjoyed using the app and have done several courses using it. However, the last update has killed it on my phone. Now, all I get is a white acreen and the phone locks up even when there are no other apps running. I hope they fix this soon."
11703,"Offline mode is just what was needed to be perfect, congrats to the team"
11704,Well I haven't tried it yet but I think it is amazingüòçüòç
11705,No Facebook login!!!!

11711,Manish tum bhi karlo bhai
11712,This app is really nice and easy to use and doesn't freeze or hang. Offline feature is also great
11713,It is one of the best learning platform.
11714,Helpful
11715,This used to be useful but without chromecast things have changed a bit. Please bring back chromecast support.
11716,"If you are currently enrolled in a course, the app is well suited for viewing videos. It is also compatible with chromecast. However, when you try looking for available courses, the app takes you to old courses, most of which are not available. This makes browsing or searching for courses very frustrating."
11717,Love it
11718,"After verification I can't watch any lectures, video is not loading"
11719,Even though I usually use coursera on larger screens the mobile experience has never failed me.
11720,Ever since the upgrade the content is impossible to download.. Videos buffer all the time..
11721,Very nice
11722,This is the one I was looking for...
11723,"I tell everyone I know about Coursera  and how with this app, they can even learn while on the bus. Little by little, you can do this!"
11724,Solved all previous issues with Chromecast
11725,Outstanding for any one with the itch to learn.
11726,Helpful aap
11727,"When ever I sign in to cousera, the app crushes... Please fix the bug!"
11728,"This is a fantastic app for those who are interested in learning more and broadening their horizons. There are so many subjects to dive into, it is hard to decide what to sign up for."
11729,Good
11730,Unable to download lectures and dosent let us choose the download location.
11731,Nice app to learn new things everyday. Waiting for support of peer graded examination support. There is a new update every next day.

11736,Like
11737,Good app but I can't save videos for offline.It shows downloading the video but when completed there will be no files in the offline section.pls fix the issue
11738,"Quits trying to play video ""oops something went wrong..."" Restarted app, restarted phone. Same error. Works on tablet so it looks like it needs way too many resources for the phone and the error reporting is poor. It's just a streaming video player!"
11739,This first came out and they didn't try and charge you hundreds of dollars for a class.
11740,Very interactive app and easy to use. Makes it much easy to keep track with classes
11741,Very useful n precious to learn more about what you do not know in specific areas of subjects

11743,Awesome for data Visualisation
11744,"the app is great and all but I got really frustrated when downloading video on WiFi, always get waiting for WiFi even if WiFi is working and the phone is 30 cm near the router. Seriously need to address this bug"

11756,Awesome app
11757,It has all the courses I need and  it is really helpful.
11758,"I truly like this platform and the app in general (especially the download of videos and immediate sync between website and app) but it bugs me that not all features are available in it... Also, it's quite bad that we cannot see imagens or graphs in the quizzes so I end up having to change to the website halfway through a quiz (and restart it) or guess the answer. The worst is that since the last update it keeps crashing, especially when trying to download videos. Huawei P8 Lite"
11759,This App made my dream of having a quality education possible. Thank you Coursera.
11760,Vary helpfull
11761,Hats-off to the amazing work done by Coursera. Especially I love the idea that access to knowledge should be free. Very useful app.
11762,Thanks for the oppurtunity of this app. Before I was able to run everything on my phone but now the crashes is to much. Disturbing my plans to watch and do my assignment. Pls do something urgently. Pls let the update be the ones that will improve user experience rather than this one. Thanks
11763,Still I am stuck in login
11764,Wonderful
11765,"When downloading videos for offline use, the app freezes and refuses to download or show courses. It's also horribly slow to navigate."
11766,"I can get it open but when I scroll, it just closes/crashes. I have a huawei p9 lite. Can you please fix it?"
11767,Fantastico

I was able to play the videos online but after a couple of weeks it started to have a problem.. it cannot play videos online no matter how many times i tried.. our net connection is just okay, i can even play youtube videos.. also, no matter how many times i tried to download the videos it just won‚Äôt.. i already uninstalled and installed it again but the condition is still the same.. i hope they will fix it cause i really enjoy this app.. btw im using the mobile version"
11860,Won't stop till you stop.
11861,"The app has been getting better and better. I started using it about a year ago and it seemed a bit buggy and disjointed, but it works well now. Chromecast always works as expected, the courses are laid out logically, you get access to every piece of functionality like accessing forums and enrolling or dropping courses."
11862,Fantabulous
11863,"Hey, the app is okay, but why is it not possible to download the lecture slides?! It is extremely annoying!"
11864,Crashes too often
11865,I wish I had more time to learn more.
11866,"The app works fine when there is a good data connection but it otherwise freezes up when trying to play downloaded videos.  It appears to forget which videos are downloaded too- the top says they are all downloaded but individual videos do not.  A way of navigating to downloaded videos would be helpful.  The videos have a Chromecast symbol on them, but it is always disabled."
11867,"With the latest version, I lost access to the downloaded videos on my device, can't see them through the app,  while they still take up 2.5GB of space. Wish I knew where they are,  but the relevant settings entry, is again missing from the latest version."
11868,Learn lots for free !!
11869,I cannot move the downloaded lectures from the mobile to the PC (as they are not included in mobile files)!
11870,Nicee
11871,"It's download the videos, but don't mark it as downloaded videos. Trying to retry, but experience same problem. I'll appreciate for your help. Anyway, i'm using LG G4 Stylus"
11872,Not able to cast video on tv using chromecast
11873,Very helpful
11874,Useful and looking forward to learning alot with this app.
11875,"I thought this is a free app. The last time I took up a business course and I completed it, it's free, all I have to pay is the certificate coming from the university. What happen?"
11876,"Every time I go to play a video, it is not possible to full screen the video/skip ahead in time/get rid of buttons on screen, and after 20 seconds the media player crashes and I have to quit the App. Happens every time I try"
11877,Wanted.
11878,"All I see is pictures, no answer options. Mobile web version doesn't have this problem but it is just poorly designed (lots of overlapping, very slow loading etc.)"
11879,Nice
11880,"Excellent app, helps me to keep abreast of course content while traveling... very convenient."
11881,Just some features still missing. But you should group courses from same specialization together.
11882,Needs improvement in syncing and performance tweaks in many areas
11883,Loved the app
11884,Features a lot of knowledge in the form of video tutorials. Recommended for anyone eager to learn new things.
11885,I've been using this for several years and it is helping me towards my larger exams at my local colleges to attain designations.
11886,Love to study in Coursera!
11887,Good
11888,Always many courses to chose from
11889,Good app.i like it
11890,By virtue of well organised online line learning platform provided by coursera students and professionals can keep themselves updated and can enrich their knowledge or skills.
11891,good site for learning. good app.
11892,And easier to use
11893,the best study app
11894,Good.app
11895,Im having problems as basic as with login
11896,Quit removing past courses!
11897,You have to pay to take classes so you can get a certificate with little rral world worth. Sucks.
11898,Really appreciate it
11899,"It is good at easy learning in mobile, But it doesn't respond some time.."
11900,Useful for knowledge
11901,Good and easy to use .can learn easily
11902,I love this app so much. It has helped me a lot
11903,"I've been enrolled in many courses for free. Some of course I paid for certificate. Easy,  affordable and helps me learn when I'm not at home."
11904,Very good . Easy to use and the course is well designed.
11905,Sololearn app is completely free for all courses and even the certificate is also free
11906,Awesome
11907,"I tried to make the payment for a course using my mobile , but I coulnd't because it doesn't let me choose my country (Brazil) or set my credit card name. But I do finished the process by my computer. I'm looking forward to see this little issue solved in near future."
11908,Really helpful...
11909,This used to be free. You only pay if you want to receive certificates and diplomas. Sorry I have to uninstall.
11910,"Great app, wish you could add playback speed to the app"
11911,"This app is a bit glitchy at times, not linking to assignments and things. However, the convenience of being able to easily keep up with lectures is fantastic. I've never paid for a course, though the option to pay for the certificate is excellent in my opinion."
11912,Worth 4 stars. Plus one for chromecast support.
11913,Must pay for course. There is no free option. Checked reviews. No one has  found free enroll option either.
11914,priceless
11915,Love this app but want to know if you get the green ck mark on each of the videos/quiz is that an indication that it is a completed part of the course?
11916,The app keeps improving
11917,"On the whole, this app is useful. It would be great if you could play at higher speeds, though"
11918,this is Sucess full for education
11919,"When I increase a video's speed, the video and it's audio get unsynchronized. Also it doesn't let me to download videos via cellular network. Update: they added downloading via cellular. Imagine you saved some videos for offline browsing and go somewhere, where there's no network available. You won't be able to see those videos, because first the app needs to download the list of your courses and then the structure of the course you want to use at the moment. It's rather silly that the app doesn't save the information about courses to make the downloaded videos available offline. So I still can't use the app offline."
11920,After logging in with Facebook it just stays on the login page with no option to go further.. Crappy total bollocks
11921,I'm so glad to know u.I love learning knowledge. I love understanding science. But I'm in bad situation that don't have this .I'm so so glad for you. I love you and thank you for helping me to be able to make my wishes true.my wish is knowledge
11922,I want all save video transfer from mobile to my laptop
11923,love it
11924,Good to have coursera in tablet for doing online courses
11925,Very good  for  those  students  who  have  limited  opportunities  but unlimited  thirst  for  knowledge
11926,Excellent
11927,it's ok
11928,The charm has lost cz u have to pay for every course . I used to like it before very much.
11929,Karti kya hai yeh vaise?
11930,Really nice app
11931,Why is it asking for a password to sign up?
11932,For some reason after sign up it wont transition to any other page
11933,There is anyone who got a certificate from this app? ?
11934,I don't understand why you need to know what apps I'm using? Browsing history? Are you spying on us?
11935,Troubles with login with facebook
11936,I love this app!
11937,SANK
11938,Very bad
11939,Good way to learn anywhere and anytime......
11940,"The world is becoming more and more developed day by day, so it's our job to enhance ourselves before we are forced to do so and coursera is one of the best ways for indulging in self paced learning and that too from top universities ad instructors"
11941,Course options are tremendous. .varied and interesting
11942,Initially started using the browser version if the app for my business analytics course and then boom! Discovered I could cast the app on my Plasma TV with the Chromecast app giving me a better experience. Love this app!
11943,"God the app is bad. Constantly switching back and forth from app to mobile browser because 'sorry this feature is only supported on web', you try to use it on a browser and chrome gives you error. And you can't request the desktop version of the site or the verification goes nuts"
11944,Stuck @ login page
11945,I've taken various courses and it works perfectly fine
11946,Wherever u r.. Never let ur classes slip away..
11947,Error 504
11948,Filthy
11949,"Many improvements to the previous versions of the Courses app. However, when reading lesson materials the text is very small and zoom in not enabled. There should be a way to adjust font size!"
11950,Last time I checked in there were plenty good free courses. None now :(
11951,ÿ®ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÜ€å
11952,The app gives us the opportunity to expand our knowledge any time any where allowing us to continue our course any where.
11953,Nice app..
11954,Nice app and very educatied
11955,The feature that allows you to take the videos offline is the best. Makes for a nice learning experience.
11956,The sound volume is too low. But the app is fantastic
11957,Give us the choice to use mobile data to download videos
11958,I want to major in Japanese but my school doesn't offer and I'm having trouble transferring. Please offer more languages.
11959,Best of the best
11960,Wonderful ammount of knowledge
11961,you can learn everything without  having any kind of skill
11962,Nice app!!! Very very very useful!
11963,HB is mark
11964,Unable to login or register after 3 4 attempts
11965,There's a facility for enrolling free. But there's no option for that! Please help...
11966,Speed and quality
11967,Thanks for great experience..
11968,"Great content, clunky app. Cons: Discussion boards practicality unusable in app. Threads don't sort properly, no search function. Other sections of course won't work on mobile, requiring a desktop or laptop computer. Mobile website completely useless. Unlikely to get through a course on mobile alone. Pro: ability to download content for offline use."
11969,Ventanas abiertas a conocimientos aldededor del mundo :)
11970,Nice
11971,Gio
11972,The stars given are for concept. Have not used it yet
11973,Pa mal!!!
11974,"I log in with Facebook and it just tells me I'm logged in, doesn't let me do anything after that. :–≥"
11975,Educational and easy to use
11976,"To submit assignments you need to log in through the browser... But when you try access the assignment page in your browser, it opens the page in the app = infinite loop of painful bad design!"
11977,Doesn't work very well when viewing videos offline. The app freezes for ages and is unresponsive when playing downloaded videos until the network connection attempts seemingly time out.
11978,Excellent Initiative
11979,Its one  of the best online course to all intellectual personality
11980,Wide platform to learn anything
11981,"Jusr installed this App, unable to login even after enabling access on my FB account... plz fix this...."
11982,Expensive to get a certificate
11983,Helping-out wow
11984,Very good
11985,Has got struck in front page
11986,Effective
11987,Nice app
11988,"The irony of the smartphones and stupid people is that here I am commenting on the service rather than commenting on the app. The courses are free to take, but you won't get certification until you pay. That's a perfectly fair deal. It takes time and effort to grade your submissions, so submissions come under the paid tier. This does not mean that you don't get to learn - the courses are free to take. The app is laggy even on powerful phones, so that certainly needs to be fixed."
11989,"In general stable, just a bit annoying to key in  logins"
11990,These courses help keep my mind sharp. Thank you.
11991,"You cannot even take a quick look at it without signing up. If you opt to use Facebook to sign up and edit it's options to remove your email it won't let you login with Facebook. I gave access to read my account info, you don't need my friend list nor do you need my email address. If you do then don't make it optional. Now that I've read that you really only sell courses and classes I can see the insistence of having my email. You'd end up on my spam list anyways."
11992,thanks for opening chances to the world. am glad because am able to access courses which are not offered to my developing nations.
11993,Best tutorials app
11994,I loved it. awesome app
11995,"I don't what has happened, i like this app and coursera too but, I've started a course as audit it for free, it had taken the week-end quiz and also accepted it but after update on the second week, is asking me to buy a course in order to submit it.... What!!! Is it..."
11996,"Since MOOCs make global launch to initiated open education, as far as I know I'm very supported to this movement, very excited. Seems well their provide app too, this is make easily me to embrace the education. Good app, good idea, good service. This is excellent."
11997,This app is as brilliant as the people who founded Coursera. I have been taking classes through them for years.
11998,computer science
11999,"Courses are well structured, lecturers are very experienced."
12000,Great app
12001,"Good, but many functionalities are still not supported on the app"
12002,Love it
12003,Very useful
12004,Nice app.
12005,This is where I fell inlove with programming!
12006,"The app doesn't direct you directly to the discussion threads. When there is an issue with the course or when we cannot complete the assignment due to the website issues, the coursera Helpdesk usually take a few hours before they understood our problems.  Not efficient and courses are refreshed without sufficient notice."
12007,Will be great
12008,"It makes learning anything from anywhere , anytime so easy!"
12009,"I can't use it at all. It says I'm signed in, but I can't see any menu, my courses or other options."
12010,Lacks a ton of things the website has which makes learning on the go really difficult.  It's basically a shell compared to the website.  Sentiment mine that coursera and make your app not completely limp.
12011,"Free education with no pesky ads? Sign me the fook up! This is so wonderful for wanting to learn something but not having to search around on the internet, only to be found in bits and pieces! Not only that, but it's more than just a broad overview of whatever and then ""OK that's it you're done"", it's just in-depth enough to firmly grasp the idea without going too far and being profoundly boring (or at least, the Stanford nutrition course. The other ones are iffy)"
12012,"Great courses, and with the new update no more ""hanging"" problems. Thank you so much :)"
12013,Informative
12014,good app
12015,This app is meant for using on a tablet. Please make the experience better.
12016,"Courses are no longer free and you can only audit them, which means you can only watch videos and cannot even test your understanding in quizes etc. Greedy moron Coursera"
12017,Please add an option to wishlist or a view later button for the courses
12018,I think you should add the feature to download course materials such as slides and Programming Assignements.
12019,"I already have an account with Coursera. Every time I try and open the app on my 5S Galaxy Android phone I can't go any farther then the login page. I have retype my information several times, I have Uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and I have even tried to make a new profile and I still cannot get passed the login page. I have Coursera on my computer but the app will not work for my phone. Will someone please fix this problem. It is annoying and frustrating."
12020,"Ever since I started using this app, everything became easy. I can learn anywhere anytime and never waste time. Keep up the good work. You help a lot of people who really need it. Thank you so much."
12021,"Certain parts are locked to portrait orientation, this makes it difficult to use especially if using on a tablet. Design for tablets could also be improved to better utilize the screen space and especially the landscape orientation."
12022,Very useful
12023,A lot. Access to every feature of coursera isn't available yet
12024,Thanks
12025,Loved it!
12026,Its just great app for all.If not believe can have it.Then....
12027,Works offline. Thank you.
12028,Great job.....knowledge shoul reach to everyone free....noble work u r doing
12029,The FUTURE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR EVERY ONE
12030,Tnx
12031,"This apps was good. I mean, of course it's better to set a laptop/pc to learn online, esp for CS courses which needed running a software, but in my rushing time this apps save me"
12032,Stucked on the login page even after logging in.
12033,"Very helpful in easily understanding d concepts via audio visuals. And, that too from internationally acclaimed universities' professors. Thanks. I revised Statistics subject after 10 yrs."
12034,Great companion to the desktop experience. Watching videos and answering quizzes is seamless and effortless with this great accompaniment. Great job coursera!
12035,I would rather prefer Some free education and not pay such huge amount on the courses.
12036,"This app is the APP! I've gained so much from this simple app and I've been spreading the word. Thank you for this opportunity. Apart from the challenge of downloading offline, nothing else to complain about."
12037,Really good app...
12038,Awesome App
12039,Good
12040,"The app is great, but I find myself unable to use Chromecast, because I won't know if I missed something important without the quizzes. Had it been able to pause the casting and show quizzes on the phone it would be perfect for me."
12041,"Poor design, unusable. It's as if a student wrote it after taking one of their classes. There is no easy way to get to discussions,  missing 90% of features found on Web,  and they force you to use this app because they removed their mobile Web site."
12042,Love
12043,"The website is very glitchy, but the app is perfectly fine."
12044,Good App
12045,Free to download but beware you have to buy every course much easier in a University instead thanks for nothing spreading the word that this app has false advertisement om the app. Contacting Samsung and tell them to delete the app for misleading students. Be prepared for losing your app.
12046,Thumbss up for this app! Happy learning everyone!
12047,"I don't know what to say to describe the opportunity brought to me through this app. It would not have been possible to complete my courses easily, but the app makes my class to be with me everywhere I go, even in the toilet! I am loving it..."
12048,Awesome app
12049,I love it.
12050,Great online studies and a great resource
12051,Love it
12052,The courses are all interesting but everything I want to do is part of a specialization or expensive.

12056,Videos for lecture programming android applications for mobile handheld systems part-1 are not opening... It keeps on giving the error to check my network connection...y internet connection is working fine... Fix this.. Is the fix temporary that the same issue arises again n again... Is there any one to fix this issue??? Now the app is also crashing..
12057,"Variety of courses available that a plus point, but it has now become chargeable."
12058,"I am regular student to your website and had learn a lot of stuffs. My question is I am staying in India, will I get the certificate or just I have to buff without certificate that I have that knowledge. The certificate will be recognized by blue chip companies?"
12059,Coursera on the go is a great way to make your journeys more productive.
12060,it isnt free
12061,Very good college for online studies
12062,Great stuff

12066,"Awesome app, would be great if screen  mirroring could be added (will enable us to see lectures on TVs)."
12067,when you have to be online to open the app...
12068,Very useful
12069,Thank You for helping those of us who cannot afford higher education have access to such a wide array of courses and resources.

12072,Great
12073,I love this app
12074,"This is a lovely app. UI is so pleasing. Hassle-free navigation. Need I talk about the courses??  Their standard is incomparable since they're coming from highly reputed Institutes. One thing I noticed is that I am not able to add due dates to the calendar although the feature is present in the app. Except this one tiny hiccup, this is an amazing app."
12075,"This is the dumbest app. It only features videos, and then everything else has to be opened on the browser. And then you have to log in again on the browser. Waste of time."
12076,"One has to click twice the play button for pausing a video to take down the notes,  causing difficulties to pause at the moment it required, I would prefer touching screen anywhere only once to pause or resume, because I had to pause these videos frequently"
12077,It's a great app. It would be even better if you could download videos for future viewing. High bandwidth connections are not always available...
12078,This program gives me the option needed to continue my studies on my own time and convenience.
12079,Thanks to the team and appreciate all the hard work put to get the world class lectures to train under a single platform. I wish to be a part of the coursera team one day !!!!!!
12080,Its really helpful
12081,A great way to study

12089,amazing stuff
12090,I downloaded coursera app and tried logging in using my registered email. It gives me a network error but my mobile is connected to the internet. Plz fix this bug asap
12091,No option to sign up with Google+
12092,Super application for learning.
12093,Easy to understand. Lectures are very fruitful
12094,Easily learning what I want and for free.
12095,Very useful
12096,The app doesn't go beyond signing in and then staying in the screen itself. Please look into this.
12097,Good work coursera
12098,"Never knew online learning could be this easier"""
12099,Now I can really learn anything anytime anywhere!
12100,No where near the online content..

12104,Ability to navigate to course page directly from the specialization page without having to purchase the specialization

12112,Great to have such a learning platform for new  skills and courses .
12113,"I like the Web interface, but the app is a bit cleaner."
12114,Couldn't even sign up with Facebook
12115,Otherwise loved it thumbs up and hats off
12116,"With headphones, I can take in a lecture on the way to and from work... And even on the toilet, if I'm particularly constipated. The built in Chromecast is fantastic, letting me watch on a television while I take notes. Sadly, on my stock Android Nexus 5, the ""Add to Calendar"" button doesn't work. That needs fixing."
12117,"I was helped a lot by coursera, and this app is a flattering way of learning with coursera."
12118,Beautiful App
12119,I can study from different weeks in the desktop site but in this app I have to complete an assessment before going to the next week. Without it the next week course is not opening. FIX THIS
12120,I like save to offline mode feature the most as it allow you to save using wifi and then watch in free time.
12121,The best App learing
12122,"Great project, great app. It just needs a setting to change video speed like the web version."
12123,"We can learn everything in here, easy to use."
12124,English MOOC
12125,Can't sign in with Facebook. It gets stuck at login page. Can't add to calendar.
12126,Great app
12127,"Apt for online courses. Hassle free. However, more features like view purchases etc. Could have been added"
12128,One stop destination for all your educational needs.Brilliant concept.kudos
12129,Very useful
12130,"This is the single must functional, useful advance in the Coursera platform over the past three years. Being able to use my commute time to study pre-downloaded lectures is AMAZING."
12131,The courses are fantastic and app is easy to use.
12132,"This app does not update on courses enrolled. No use, no sweat."
12133,Can't sign in with Facebook.  It doesn't go beyond sign in screen. It always stays on sign in screen even though I'm already signed in
12134,Excellent
12135,User friendly app
12136,It's very helpful to be able to download all the videos for offline viewing. I usually use it to watch my MOOCs while I'm stuck in traffic
12137,"No more free learning, bye bye coursera"
12138,Thank you.
12139,Really loved it
12140,The Best/Right place for learning
12141,"I'm trying to add the course deadlines to my calendar, but the feature is not working."
12142,The app is awesome plus the feature to use the chromecast dongle to cast over the TV and the subtitles on the TV is working nicely. Thanks for hearing my needs and for everyone else.
12143,"The idea is grate. The functionality is OK. When used on smartphone, forces to use the internet from mobile provider. When I change the settings to WiFi connection when in range it just blocked all lectures. After changing back it didn't work, so I had to reinstall it. Too bad.. All that does not encourages to use the app."
12144,Useful

12152,"I'm logged in with my FB account, because it asks if I want to log out when I tap 'log out with Facebook. Not sure how to actually get to the courses; there is no selection!"
12153,A filter must be added for free and paid courses
12154,Could not login at all
12155,Very good
12156,Tired of daily updates.
12157,I have always enjoyed the accessibility of your app but most recently I have been experiencing some issues with actual getting past the login screen. I've already uninstalled/reinstalled the app. Any suggestions?
12158,Gives all the courseware one needs on to android. No need to power up the PC!
12159,"Java error 409... Ya sure, those programming error messages are a great user experience. Keep it up"
12160,Crashes every time when video starts
12161,The app is not allowing me to login even after I input correct credentials and reset my password. Still no success

12191,"I wanted to read a course, but i don't see the read or anything button, all i could see is ""Buy"" button at the bottom of my screen. What's the matter?"
12192,Could not sign in
12193,Won't download!!
12194,You can find online the same material for free
12195,Marvellous...
12196,Good
12197,It is usrfull for everyone
12198,It's getting better every update
12199,Am g
12200,Doesn't have ability to change playback speed and doesn't remember last point in video. Otherwise would be 5 stars
12201,Thank
12202,I thought it's free so I downloaded this app
12203,Excellent App
12204,Easy of use
12205,"The app has very nice features, and it would be an easy game to get 5 stars, but there are simply too many frustrating offline bugs which sometimes make it a pain to use.. as there were, when offline 1) it will refuse to enter previously downloaded video sections. 2) The app randomly logs out and requires to reenter the credentials with internet connection 3) Even when wifi is available, refuses to enter courses because it still thinks it's offline 4) Download queue disappears 5) Login requires many retries"
12206,"Many lectures available, very easy to use. When watching videos offline, it's too bad that it's not marked as read. When watching videos offline, be sure to turn your phone data off if there is no or poor network, otherwise the app would crash or freez."
12207,I just love coursera's platform.  I'll definitely recommend it for learning top courses.
12208,Wish list is missing.. where can I find it
12209,Useful
12210,This new update sucks. I'm unable to play any videos even after downloading. Please fix.
12211,Works fine on PC and on my phone. Really helpfull. I like it.
12212,Language learning is made into a lot of fun.
12213,The course is very simple to understand . Very clear and easily understood. I like it. It expand my knowhow. Thanks a lot.
12214,"You should make the user able to open every course from each specialization individualy when I click on it from the specialization's page, you should do the same on the website."
12215,"Hi ! I just want to pay for the second course ( R programming ) however whenever I press on the link to pay for single course , it asks me to pay for the first course of specialization. I want just the second one ."
12216,Grt app...
12217,In my lenovo k3 note it's not opening for v6.
12218,Doesn't show anything
12219,Great tool for learning.
12220,"I came here from TED talk of Daphne Koller, and tried it. It's similar to khan academy, but more organised and has more courses.."
12221,The new version is better designed and saved videos don't hang.
12222,The videos are saved but they don't show up in the app.
12223,This is the best learning app I hv ever come across
12224,Free education? 5 stars.
12225,"The app is amazing, everything is working fine but I am giving it 3 stars only because I cannot find a way to delete the offline content for courses that I have un-enrolled from another device or the website. You should add a place where I can easily manage all the offline content."
12226,Love it
12227,Loved it
12228,Good job done team coursera
12229,I came across this app and stopped searching for any other apps because it is so easy to use. Kudos to Courseera team for offering this great environment for learning.
12230,"Adding dates to calendar deletes icons from screen and all programs. Details:  I missed some assignments in digital video processing so I was prompted to join next session - I accepted it. Then it prompted me to add new schedule to calendar and I accepted it. Then I closed coursera. That's it. When I went to main screen I saw some 8-10 icons were missing from several screens (like edX, Paytm, etc.). I went to all programs and there also icons were deleted. In Apps - some entries were deleted."
12231,"Since they're offering a complete online college experience and expect to be paid for doing so, they make it difficult/impossible to access course material for free. They should just become a for profit organization. Then I would have known not to waste my time. False advertising."
12232,Luv this appppp
12233,"Videos can be a little glitch sometimes, but otherwise it's great"
12234,It often hangs and it's heavy on memory resources
12235,The best educational  app i have found in the play store. Easy to learn and access videos.
12236,"Amazing opportunity to take courses for free, that most cannot afford. Courses from the best universities in the world. Never feel intimidated, as the professors make you feel comfortable."
12237,One of the best
12238,"I haven't actually used it yet, but I'm glad I have the option of using it"
12239,Sketchy app that keeps opening itself for no reason. Coursera ruined their site anyways making this useless.
12240,I can't review videos from past weeks
12241,Love it!!!
12242,Great
12243,It is good to download it
12244,It says check your email id & pwd
12245,Easy to use..
12246,Now none of free courses exist
12247,Swety
12248,I love it
12249,Its  a   good    app   for   lovers    of    programming
12250,Fantabules!
12251,Has bugs
12252,Voice of the lecturer is too much low. It can't be heard properly. It is inconvenience to study when I'm in the mobile activities.Please fix. Thanks.
12253,Wisdom is key
12254,"Wanted to do my coursework on my Kindle Fire tablet, but this app doesn't support DIRECTLY from Amazon. Coursera staff were kind enough to direct me to a YouTube video that shows how to get around this. It seems kind of silly to have to dance around like this to do something routine, but I am happy now!"
12255,Just love itüòâ
12256,App is very slow it takes 2-3 sec for click event
12257,Great opportunity  for self learning
12258,I 've learned a lot
12259,Would like to be able go between devices. Courses bought on mobile cannot be continued on a laptop.
12260,thanks for the knowkedge
12261,Revolutionizing education
12262,Though it would help a lot if all features work and we do not need to go to web.
12263,Very useful
12264,An excellent platform for MOOCs and a great way to study online courses. Thanks Coursera!
12265,all courses r paid
12266,Heard a lot
12267,Nice studying
12268,When without reception I find the app freezes for a while before I can play offline content.
12269,"I actually have a feature request.. There are some places where I can't play videos from my course, so, if there is a way of viewing page slides from the app offline, it would be pure awesome!"
12270,It is a great way to improve knowledge in our own are or learn New things from other areas.
12271,Thank you all for all the hard work you did to bring knowledge to everyone on the earth appreciate that
12272,Useful nd informative
12273,Offline courses are not showing up. The app response is so slow. Never get my courses list rendered.
12274,"I have learned alot and its free, mostly"
12275,No option in mobile app for enrollment.. Only buying option..
12276,I cant access offline translation
12277,Fantastic
12278,"Useful when using, though a note taking feature would be nice. Drains battery quickly though as it continues to run in the background."
12279,"I like the offline feature , amazing sec to learn something new"
12280,"Love this app, it's just awesome!"
12281,More of a problem with the business model (and me) than the app.
12282,Fruitful app!!
12283,Thanks for providing medium to learn free
12284,It's a great way to review the course content while traveling. Nice work Coursera!
12285,Offline connectivity doesn't work
12286,Great App. Everything so synced perfectly and no performance issues.
12287,thanks
12288,Why am I not able to take peer review assignments on this app....please add this feature....I dont have PC...I completely depend on this app....I need the provision to take all type of assignments on this app
12289,Great education
12290,One can take a test but not verify. No verification renders the test invalid. Same for assignment. This happened with me and lead to loss of my time and effort! And there is no remedy for this except register for new session and lose more time!
12291,Tough courses easy courses ..all are there thank-you
12292,Helpful
12293,"Stupid yo like, yeah"
12294,This bloody thing crashed. It just crashed and left loads of junk on my phone.
12295,Love it
12296,Gud learning values
12297,Love this
12298,"I actively use Cousera over my PC. That's why I was excited to see the mobile app. But it isn't logging in,  no matter how many times I try. My phone Meizu M2 Note."
12299,Very helpful
12300,Nothing free! I do not understand what this app offers?!
12301,"If I could, I would give -1,000,000 stars!, I have yo pay for EVERYTHING"
12302,Great to see. ..
12303,"1) add possibility to play video lectures 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0 times faster; 2) add page where one can access all downloaded videos and delete sime or all of them if necessary (see edx app). 3) add possibility to somehow archive courses without unenrolling. Best wishes anyway the app is becoming more and more useful."
12304,Good app! but still some things need to be done!!!
12305,Excellent
12306,I love being able to access my lectures anywhere I go.
12307,Although the app is awesome but the biggest problem is that it consumes a lot of mobile data. Kindly make it usable for low speed internet connection too i.e for 2G/3G also. At this juncture it's too heavy.
12308,"Says it's free for classes, just need to pay for certificate. NO CLASSES ARE FREE ANYMORE!!!"
12309,It's awesome
12310,It is very helpful in learning. I love coursera.
12311,I had learn in this site since 3 years ago. I had got so many information from this site.
12312,"Devs, what have you done? :( The joy of taking a quiz and knowing the results should not be associated with payment. Only certificate should be based on payment. I've done 5 courses by acquiring close to 100 % grades but you've killed the joy now. :( Please restore unpaid quiz results."
12313,"I love it every thing about it, their service, they're everything rules, it's so awesome! Thanks for developing this app developers! You the best!"
12314,It helps me
12315,Not going to pay for courses that I can get books
12316,It's not free .. I don't understand.. Please help me to understand this app.. I'm interested..
12317,I couldn't control the speed of the video via the app. Pls add in such feature
12318,I swear it told me to pay $355 or something. You could've told me that I had to pay or at least have in app purchases...
12319,It does what it is supposed to do in a great way. I find it much easier to go through the courses using the app. The offline feature helps me a lot.
12320,Performance is very poor. Most of the screens take a lot of time to load. Assessment screens turn blank randomly.
12321,"I really like this app. It is a great way to view course material. However, there is a bug that caused me to have to go back to my PC. When in the middle of a lecture a quiz pops up, there are no options visible for me to select. I could see the images and the question at the top of the screen, but there was no place for me to enter in my answer. I have a Nexus 6."
12322,Works seemlessly over various gadgets; I listen to my lesson while driving to from work if I need to revisit any topic.
12323,"Most course videos are great on the mobile phone so the app is a good option for watching lessons. I have an issue with removing downloaded videos as the remove all option doesn't work reliably. I don't know if the content is still stored & can't figure out where to verify. When I am on the go with an unreliable data connection, I can access my downloaded content by switching to airplane mode (quick way to turn off network connections). It makes the app perform better and not get hung for connection."
12324,"Before this update, i was able to see my courses and even watch my ""save for offline"" videos when i am connected to the internet ... now i cannot even see my courses or anything except the tabs labels when internet is not there ... please fix fast"
12325,"There are no dates on anything. I've studied for two weeks, then realised I have no idea when the course started, when it ends or when I'm supposed to do things. I only just realised because most of the forum comments are months old. What a mess."
12326,Quick on lollipop but slow on kitkat
12327,Good app but cannot be installed on SD card. Pity
12328,"Slow, take quite long time to load the courses.  Also for the courses I preview in the desktop does not show, and I even could not find it in the search, try ""Natural Language Processing"" provided by Stanford."
12329,"Add the possibility to cast subtitles to the chromecast, not only the video"
12330,Simply superb as per knowledge enhancement. Like so much
12331,"The app was working very well until this update. As I tried to update the application, it showed error 505. I uninstalled Coursera and tried to re install it again. But to no avail. This time, I cant install it at all.  UPDATE: Error is resolved and I was able install it.  Now, the app seems to working as it should but there is no ICON visible. I have to go to settings-&gt;apps / play store to launch Coursera."
12332,"Worked fine until last update, wouldn't update, tried to reinstall but errors out. Please fix"
12333,ML class for Andrew NG week 1 has been dissappeared after I updated coursera !!
12334,"Love the content, the app can be buggy."
12335,"Got the update request for this app but keeps giving me the following error when trying to update, wondering if anyone else is getting the same error: Coursera can't be installed. Try again, and if the problem continues, get help troubleshooting. (Error code: -505). Update: was contacted by Coursera and application is working perfect now!"
12336,Nice app but can't view week 1 of some courses.
12337,I really enjoy this app.  It's truly the gateway to information on courses and the institutions that offer them.
12338,"Content is good,  but videos are not opening.  Please work on performance."
12339,This is a great application and an outstanding learning platform.
12340,EVERY COURSE SAYS COMING SOON!!!!!!! Nothing is available
12341,Can't update even tried many times
12342,A truly useful app!
12343,Subtitles are not working offline for the downloaded videos.
12344,Cannot install the latest update. Even after uninstalling cannot reinstall it. Frustrating! Error code -505 on Lollipop.
12345,Great
12346,So useful for science lovers
12347,I love learning and have so little time to do it.  Using the Coursera app allows me to brighten up my brain anywhere! The professors are outstanding and very challenging. Thank you for the work you do.
12348,Cannot install app on my S7 edge
12349,Better than edx. And each update makes it even better. Unlike most apps where update ruins all the fun.
12350,"It's very annoying, some pages are forced portrait, and the font size is too small. It would be great, if there were option to adjust font size. In addition some parts are only accessible by the web site."
12351,"EXTREMELY EASY TO USE, SO CONVENIENT, SUPER EDUCATIONAL SWAG"
12352,Thank you coursera
12353,"Update can't be installed, error code 505"
12354,When I start downloading all video. It starts simultaneously due which sometime when we leave home none of the video is completed. So please provide an option in the app to download one by one
12355,Really helpful. Learned a lot using this App. Offline mode is very useful. I will be happy if Coursera add C programming language course.
12356,It says coursera can't be installed error 505
12357,I'm looking for more enhancements. Good work team!
12358,It is a very good application always enhanced. Love it.
12359,Simply love it
12360,"Good, thanks!"
12361,"Even though the save for offline feature didn't work very well before ( not downloading all videos for a section ) it was the only reason I used this app. I like watching the lectures on my way to work, please put this back."
12362,Great!
12363,Once video saved.. Its difficult to open  without wifi or net pack.. Otherwise its easy way learning
12364,Very useful
12365,It's easy to use
12366,"crashes constantly! also just recently, it does not load my course."
12367,Very helpful app.
12368,"I have a web account and now I want to have this app on my smart phone. When I tried to log in, it said I'd had an account. However I couldn't because I forgot my password. I reset my password but it didn't accept my new one. In the end I gave up and uninstalled this app."
12369,Beautiful and easy to acess anytime of the day. I don't have to log in into my computer to access.
12370,It has pretty much everything you want.
12371,I am having problems with quizzes on the app when they contain pictures. It doesn't load the multiple choice answers and the submit button after the picture.
12372,"I'm not being able to take the tests. Every time I try for tests, a message stating, ""This quiz is currently only supported in web"" pops up."
12373,"I have just one request: add an option where by a course video watch gets saved automatically after watching. THAT IS, YOU CAN WATCH A VIDEO WHILE IT IS DOWNLOADING, OR SIMPLY, ANY VIDEO WATCHED, REMAINS FOR VIEWING OFFLINE."
12374,"There was once a scathing review here. Now let this stand as a testament to the success of the developers. Good work. This is great once more. Compatible across the devices I've tried, from tablets to phones."
12375,Cancelled installation because of asking my contacts' details
12376,Win chun
12377,"For all the courses I'm currently doing, I've saved the videos saved offline. But when I'm actually offline the subtitles don't work, when I come online the subtitles work. Sometimes the subtitles don't work at all. I do not know why this is happening."
12378,Why it is asking for submitting photo and identity again and again after each update ?
12379,"a potentially very useful functionality is limited by the fact that videos often download as 0kb, and cannot play.  the app appears to go through the whole download process, but at the end, the file is 0kb. you then need to delete and retry, until it finally downloads correctly."
12380,Amassing program
12381,Great full for free courses from Stanford in nutrition thanks
12382,Handy and easy to use
12383,"I think this is a good idea, but that is all this is, an idea, so many bugs that its impossible to complete work and even worse if you paid for the courses because nobody responds to emails, just take your money and forget about you, many links not work and crash, this makes it impossible to progress through the course"
12384,Good app
12385,Good
12386,Good
12387,Best learning app I have seen so far!!
12388,Not able see the link of videos
12389,"Downloaded 4 lectures to watch in the subway, after watching the first video - the whole week just disappeared from the app as if it never existed. Had to reinstall the app to see it again."
12390,Great
12391,Learning easy online
12392,Saved videos have disappear after latest update. Current courses are also not visible.
12393,Good
12394,Must have
12395,Thanks for listening to your users Coursera!  The app is now totally awesome.  You should mention your video playback speed feature in your summary of the app.  I'm sure lots of people will be great use of this!  Thanks!
12396,WiFi is enough to download videos to listen while commuting
12397,Getting too many updates
12398,It works perfectly. I am able to download my videos and also verify my identity after every test.
12399,Good app for good learning purposes.....
12400,Always says Oops something went wrong. Please check your network connection and try again...
12401,OK
12402,One of the most real useful apps
12403,V informative
12404,Knowledge you get from here is as good as in colleges
12405,Too good
12406,Kinetic and static
12407,"I can't open the app when offline, how can I view my downloaded courses?"
12408,Like the ability to download videos to my phone!
12409,"First check your email and password, yet I'm sure they are rigyt, Onky in my tenth attempt ir so, the apo recognised it ! There is no speed button, and as for the questions during the class,the video stopsm  the question appears yet the answers are invisible, so can't answer !"
12410,It was very helpful for a course I did.
12411,I love it!
12412,"Don't do any assignments on the app, or even the mobile site on your phone. Your identity won't be verified and you will be ineligible for your certificate!"
12413,The app seems to work fine. I am able to download videos and view them either online or offline and have participated in the forums without any problems do far.
12414,Nothing about course information is updated. The project I was enrolled and using from website is locked in the app. Very disappointed
12415,Great
12416,You can now increase the speed of the video. Perfect!
12417,I think there must be wishlist to enroll later
12418,App is buggy and difficult to navigate. Videos downloaded for offline viewing cannot be played offline. For me this is a fatal flaw so I won't be signing up to another course in a hurry.
12419,"Lots to learn, Coursera is the platform to do just that!"
12420,I loved Prof Wright's easy going style. He is obviously passionate about music but gets his udeas across as if you were in the same room. Most enjoyable
12421,Course access.
12422,The best application ever seen
12423,I like it
12424,- the app doesn't sync up with the progress ?
12425,It is just an awesome site
12426,Why can I not enroll for free from the app like I can in a browser?  I'm not interested in paying for the $300+ course. I'm a stay at home mom who just wants to do something in my spare time so as to feel like my mind isn't mush. I thought that this would be an easier way to do such from my tablet. Way to prove me completely wrong. My advice... Give us an option.  Is it really that hard for you to do?
12427,Great learning app
12428,Great user interface
12429,This is awesome software and I would recommend it too any child or adult in pursuit of higher education.
12430,Learn Anything Anytime from the best in field and that too free
12431,Very best
12432,A great platform to learn online courses at your own convenient time...
12433,It's really awesome
12434,After completing one of the courses; Coursera accepted my payment and until today after more than three months they have yet to issue me a receipt or a cert. Have written to them but no respond. Very annoyed and disappointed.
12435,From two days I am trying to sign up but shows check your email and password. Please solve this problem. I have checked my email and even changed my password twice but it doesn't works.
12436,A battery drainer. 7% while app wasn't even opened. And please add a possibility to view videos at a higher speed. Thanks
12437,"The best of the best of online leaning this app is awesome,special and unique.I love this!"
12438,"Watch out, this app wants to eat your contacts!!!"
12439,can't get week one... how will i go on with my course and whom will i contact for this?  kindly help
12440,You can't log in with Facebook on the mobile app.
12441,"Very nice app and easy to find courses and videos.  I have one problem though, and it's a bug in my opinion of the app.  You support offline videos, which is AWESOME! BUT, how am I supposed to see them when I am offline if your app does not show me what videos I have available in order to choose them?:) The app just shows a loading animation when offline so the offline videos are just useless really!"
12442,Thx
12443,After more than a dozen courses complete there is so much to learn
12444,Loved it.....
12445,Excellent
12446,Love it
12447,Reliable access to resources through the app in my experience. Very useful to watch course content on the go and the ability to download and watch offline. I often also watch lectures on my phone so I can work along with it on my computer. Good stuff.
12448,"- App has many screens which force portrait orientation - no excuse for this. - You are constantly bothered by screens telling you to pay for course certificates or sign up for horrendously overpriced 'specializations'. - You can't complete most assignments using the app - you have to use the website which, just to be extra helpful, doesn't support verification. - The app's verification only works 50% of the time. - The forums don't work reliabily in the app.  Sometimes no posts show up, sometimes old posts show up.  What's the point of this app if you can't access all the things you need to complete a course?    This is a really poor app for a platform which was once good, but is rapidly becoming more commercial and seems to be deteriorating rapidly."
12449,Student Usefull app
12450,I just loved the way of teaching .
12451,Very useful.
12452,There is so much free information now with thought provoking instructors. It's hard to choose between so many!
12453,Learn more with coursera...
12454,Love it
12455,Great app to access course content
12456,Really thank you.
12457,App is storing the offline video in Internal memory of my android phone.  How can it be moved to external device like SD card?
12458,I signed up using the login with your Facebook option which I no longer have access to in the app.
12459,No source code available.
12460,Thanks to the developers and tutors in courses who are providing it. Never felt so hungry for knowledge. Thanks guys. Lovvee it üòç
12461,"Does the job. Download videos, watch on the train."
12462,I have propleme as the subtitle don't work even if I choose language ?
12463,Easy. Simple.
12464,Great courses and free
12465,"The app is great and it would get 5 stars if it was possible to speed up (or slow down) the videos, like on the computer."
12466,It's a great app. I love it works offline ajd online. Can save videos and watche them later.
12467,It has improved a lot since last time i saw it. I like that you can watch offline but it would be extremely handy if there was a possibility to play videos in faster speed.
12468,Takes forever to load
12469,I've realized you guys are working really hard to make the mobile experience as good as desktop. Well done! I'm enjoying the experience.
12470,Not able to save video on mobile after latest update
12471,Good app to develop knowledge
12472,Worth app
12473,"Not able to see any videos, course content after the update. While I can by Brower. Please resolve this issue."
12474,Great way to learn from home
12475,Have done three music courses from theory to composition.
12476,I logged in via facebook account in the previous versions now there are no such options available in mobile version.
12477,"Good for downloading course videos, but quizzes just show up blank, or at best you might get a couple answers showing."
12478,Also truth for enhancement of social skills and free-time curiosity app
12479,Awesome application
12480,this app works wonderful. to me this app is more convenient than coursera website
12481,Hell app not a single free course
12482,"Aplicativo bom,  mas ainda apresenta algumas falhas,  tanto de usabilidade quanto de performance."
12483,I loved it
12484,Perfect place to get quality education from the world's most renowned universities!!
12485,Classroom Awesomeness
12486,"My daughter loves to learn french and spanish so she learnt them from this coursera .. Noe , shr became perfect in both."
12487,Love the whole idea of training anywhere you go or even listening to the classes during traffic.. no more excuses for not cultivate yourself !!
12488,Useful
12489,"Why does an educational app need to dig so deeply into my device's personally identifiable information? I would, honestly, like to know."
12490,"Much better than the Udacity app! Especially supporting play back speed adjustment. One request, can you add 1.75x to the speed option? The desktop version has it but mobile does not."
12491,Wow
12492,Desde la √∫ltima actualizaci√≥n los videos no se reproducen si estoy fuera de l√≠nea
12493,"I reported a problem with its app yesterday. I got an update today! I am surprised to see the speed with which they have solved this problem. Compare that with Whatsapp, to which I have been reporting a problem since a very long time (1 year), but they have t not solved it. Hats off to Coursera tech team..."
12494,Now it works thanks :) quick turnaround guys!
12495,I want the play speed control feature.
12496,"It's easy to use, has tons of options, but I wish there were courses for Japanese"
12497,Can't get the Stanford machine learning course to load though!
12498,Very useful
12499,Kudos for you. I love this app.
12500,I've found and plan to enroll in a lot of interesting courses.  No downsides thus far.
12501,great work
12502,But downloaded videos are not working properly
12503,Ok
12504,Its okay
12505,Best part you can earn yourself a certificate of authenticity of Completeness of a said course.
12506,"I encounter a problem in Coursera's offline mode. I use wifi network to save videos to watch them offline. But when I turn wifi and mobile data off, the videos won't load any my Sony Xperia C4 dual says Coursera is not responding. The screen keeps black and I had to close Coursera."
12507,love it
12508,"This is vry beneficial for students.., I loved it.:-)"
12509,"The Android app is lacking some features that the iOS version has.  First of all, it doesn't allow to change the playback speed.  Secondly (and most importantly) the Android app doesn't allow me to watch previously saved videos if I have no Internet connection at the moment. It even crashes. It is like it has to load the course information (which is just plain text), but as it doesn't have a connection at that moment, the course never loads and I can't see the videos."
12510,Great
12511,Thank you Coursera
12512,"Worse and worse with every release. Offline mode does not work anymore, error messages are uninformative and annoying (""something went wrong"").   A missed opportunity, and a total waste of time."
12513,"One month ago, this would have been a 5/5, no question.  You've done something now though, where downloaded videos are a mess.  Downloading says it's all done, bit can't watch offline, can't remove from device, and coursera spontaneously crashes when attempting to view.  Sort it out!"
12514,"Same problem as some other posters: I can't access the Machine Learning course at all via the app.  Whenever I click on it, I get ""Something went wrong.  Please check your network connection and try again.""  Same result no matter whether I'm on wifi or data."
12515,Eagerly waiting for Mobile App-based Verification for submissions of assignments. Otherwise awesome app!
12516,I wish it didn't crash so frequently. also the downloaded videos play only the first time. I can't rewatch it again. otherwise a nice app with useful learning contents.
12517,Great minds comes from coursera
12518,This last update yielded errors while the app was installed on the SD card.
12519,Doesn't change with tablet orientation
12520,Easy to improve on oneself and acquire more certificate courses without necessarily needing to travel to different universities around the world.
12521,Unable to update
12522,Enterperneur
12523,Perfect!
12524,"Every time I try to load my class in the app, it says something went wrong and I should check my connection. This makes the app completely useless for me."
12525,Great way to get inspired.
12526,Fab aap
12527,Highly recommended
12528,Guys this is good. I am doing my second course with them but super costly. People are paying money because of the university names which looks attractive for first 2 certifications. After that I think people will move to Udemy if these guys dont come up with some loyalty program.
12529,Brilliant
12530,Very productive and valuable app
12531,best app seen for video tuts...
12532,i love this app. i use it almost every day. good job guys
12533,Threads and discussions are the best way to reach out to fellow course mates. I am sure you will take notice of its importance in MOOCs.
12534,"It always says ""oops something went wrong. Try to check your network connection""... Help me through this"
12535,It really enhances knowledge
12536,Great Profesor in my room
12537,Won't run on my remix ultratablet
12538,Great
12539,Not free
12540,I'm very impressed with the quality of education available for free. To access for free click 'enrol' on an individual course (not a specialisation) and then choose the no certificate option.
12541,It has revolutionized and redefined world class learning and education for me!
12542,Learning Chinese has been simplified soo perfectly. I love it
12543,"Not very many free courses anymore,  if you're willing to drop $400 for a class have at it, but this is definitely not for lower income people like myself..."
12544,Nice app
12545,"Paid for two courses but one course doesn't show up at all and the other one and me to pay again to upload assignments. Coursera cannot be contacted, instead they have a troubleshooting forum. Cannot get a refund because the courses don't appear in my 'purchased' tab but the money has been taken out of my account. Lots of people have reported the same problem in the forum but got no response from coursera. I lost a big sum of money and so did many others."
12546,"Download for off-line still doesn't work for me. Progress moves for some time but then just disappears and nothing changed. 32 Gb SD card, 4 Gb free. So I have to use regular media player and download/copy manually"
12547,Useful
12548,Won't reset the password nor let me sign in with other accounts!
12549,Thanks for this amazing app it's very useful and user friendly
12550,I'm using the app on a tablet (tf201 stock) and it works well. Only two things are buggin me: (1) the outline isn't rotating to landscape and quizzes only seem to work when I'm online. Also for questions/answers with some math forumla they dissappear after some time and show a math error.
12551,A 2.x and 1.5x speed should be available for the video player
12552,Great app. Only thing it needs is a remember  specialization  kind of thing.
12553,Great app
12554,So many good courses
12555,Mentions nowhere that the courses are not free
12556,For me this is the best app to learn and also it surprises me every time because it offers more and more courses but also related with innovative topics and a lot of them are for free. Thanks Coursera!
12557,Some of these teachers move too fast through the course and I have to go back to hear the thing all over again. For intro to mathematical thinking the 1st problem set I did almost made me feel like I had not even done lectures one and two. And this makes me want to get my own personal teacher that teaches for the sake of knowledge and not money &gt;.&lt;
12558,Keep up the good work.
12559,Love it
12560,A good source of Knowledg
12561,Complete knowledge about Digital Marketing
12562,One of the best app in the field of education.
12563,Pop-up management needs better design.
12564,Helps me at school
12565,Excellent
12566,Very good
12567,Love learning via this appüòçüòò
12568,Keepe crashing and getting stuck.
12569,I can't use it for free as it says i could .. i can't pay almost 500$ per course .. i hope it could be more clear to use
12570,e.g. SD card... or at least give the video files coherent names.
12571,Great work Coursera Team.
12572,Its easy fast and you can learn anything you want
12573,Liked it
12574,The pop quiz during a lecture keeps appearing multiple times despite that I already finished it. The multiple choices quiz doesn't load all of the choice text. It shows blank text in several choices.  Edit: I don't have a trouble of blank text in pop quiz anymore. Although it still shows up multiple time.
12575,I loved this game and it is very nice game and scientific
12576,I really appreciate this company
12577,Very useful
12578,I like the way on the web the placback can be set to a desired speed appreciated if that feature is possible in the app also
12579,"Whether I try to watch online or download the videos first, if I attempt to watch the video I get an error message saying 'Something went wrong. Check your network connection and try again'. I can hear the sound of the video. This is even with downloaded videos."
12580,"App crashes are become more and more frequent with the last few updates. The video simply freezes when the device is inactive for a few seconds more than screen lock time and then hangs. Quite annoying that I'm restarting my phone a few times in an hour. Additionally, there isn't an option to change video display speed.  The structure to each course (in terms of course documentation, lecture slides etc) needs to be more uniform."
12581,Coursera sold out to their VC pimp daddies and won't even let you take a quiz for free. Coursera is now a crappy youtube for over simplified feel-good courses. GG see you at edX.
12582,Gives one access to college courses in many fields.
12583,Helpful
12584,very good app
12585,Awesome
12586,"Much better now that they have Chromecast support, still a little buggy but much better. I love using Coursera to further my education. Knowledge is power people, learn something!"
12587,I recently updated my coursera app and it logged out my account. I tried to log in but it keeps crashing. I also reinstalled it but it's crashing. Please fix it immediately. Thank you!
12588,"I love coursera, one of my favorite things is being able to crank up the professors lecture speed. The mobile app needs that."
12589,Can't find anything worth the time
12590,Good
12591,"Before it wasn't that good. But now it is awesome. You can do almost everything of coursework, from watching videos (both online and offline) to discussion in the forum to completing the assignments. You will require PC only to do programming. Otherwise complete package for coursework. Fantastic."
12592,Great
12593,I can access the course videos but when it comes to weekly quizzes or assignments I have problem. On some quizzes parts of the questions are missing so the question is incomplete. On submitting assignments some buttons do not work. So the app is only good for watching videos.
12594,Babal xe....
12595,Mobile learning at its best
12596,i hope there will be Deutsch course.
12597,Like
12598,Thank you
12599,It's very nice
12600,Amazing source of knowledge
12601,Great app with minor issue: it doesn't support landscape screen orientation properly.
12602,Best self-learning mobile tool with a fantastic collection of MOOCs for all fields.
12603,Excellent
12604,Easy to use and very beneficial
12605,Lovely opportunity to find out some new stuff even when you travel.
12606,Study made easy. Navigation more interesting
12607,I can't adjust the video playing speed
12608,Nice
12609,Excellent
12610,Very nice
12611,Really helpful for entrepreneurship.
12612,I strongly recommend this app.
12613,Great Idea
12614,"At first it was buggy,  but now the app rocks"
12615,Great
12616,the content and quality is nice
12617,Subtitles of almost classes are wrong (unmatch) and fail to fetch.
12618,Great app
12619,"Whenever I try to open any course, it says ""oops something went wrong."" I am uninstalling this non-sense."
12620,Very useful learning app
12621,Really useful for students of developing countries which doesn't have great universities like US. Now people in developing countries can get education from great universities at an affordable price. The developers of coursera should be given a Nobel prize.
12622,"I love the new UI, runs just fine, convenient and easy to use!"
12623,Crashes on asus memo pad 10.
12624,Crashes immediately on my Tab S2
12625,UMENDRA
12626,A nice educator
12627,Exactly what I needed
12628,Immediately crashes on start on my Nexus 7 tablet. Doesn't work at all.
12629,As I am using this service provided by coursera is awesome and helpful to learn through top university's certification for free.
12630,Loved the app and the concept of availing education on mobile.
12631,Very impressive
12632,It's really awesome. Easy to use. Mobile friendly.
12633,Just perfect
12634,Pathetic app and more pathetic customer service
12635,"We should be able to share courses. I mean, over WhatsApp, etc..."
12636,Found a way of putting the course materials onto the sd card on an HTC desire and love it you can download the material and select options use sd card....:-)
12637,Great app for learner
12638,It assumes that you can always connect to the internet. Performance of the platform has dropped drastically.                                               Performed the latest update on 2/18/2016 makes it even worse.....
12639,Excellent form of studying
12640,Good content
12641,Excellent
12642,Sheer brilliance!
12643,"Unfortunately, Coursera has stopped.."
12644,"Now, you can educate yourself at home on a smartphone."
12645,High quality education for the 99%
12646,No need for a computer. I really love it
12647,Great App :)
12648,Tons of notifications that take you to the discussion top level page. Absolutely no value in this app.
12649,Any chance to add an option to cast to Amazon Fire TV? It'd be awesome. :)
12650,Overall i am really impressed by this app but it would be better if you include the course wiki as well. Also sometimes there are glitches when you try to take a quiz and some answers don't show up and whole questions are obscured.
12651,Useful for education
12652,Good
12653,Vj
12654,"It's a great app to learn, keep adding new courses"
12655,Loved it very useful and easy
12656,"When I enrolled for a course and I went to see it on my courses, it was under complete even though I haven't done any work on it"
12657,Unable to open the assignment page please help
12658,"Some of the content I accessed via this app was terrific, but those were written by their prospective publishers, and not by the developers of this app, so it's crazy when I see reviews of this app based on the value one  received from a certain course they accessed through this app. This app has very dangerous and unusual access and ROOT level permissions, why must you upload my personal data, passwords and contacts, and texts to your servers?"
12659,The download progress is not shown sometimes and we have to refresh the page again nd again to see download progress.
12660,"I love this app, but please please allow to save content on external card for offline view. Currently you support only internal memory which is very limited."
12661,"At this point, I call BS. Why do I have to deal with ios when I am an Android user?  Where is the Android Quiz instead of the set me up for failure ios quiz?"
12662,"Videos play fine, transcripts available, useful course information. Orientation behavior broken. Hoping for some features: Video speed control. Offline supplemental content. Feedback separation (not all one big blob). Orientation fix/control for docks/tablets (in the meantime Rotation Control by CrapeMyrtle forces Coursera to orient properly)."
12663,Gghh
12664,Courses are too pricey and there's no filter to search by price. Having to tap on Buy is very discouraging.
12665,Great
12666,"I can't dismiss notifications. Once I've downloaded a course video and I get 'Your downloads are ready' as a notification, I should be able to dismiss it. That's my only gripe. The app is good, minimal features, works well."
12667,Best apps for learning
12668,This app is a very useful learning tool.
12669,Love it absolutely..
12670,Does a good job
12671,This app is give the good opportunity & guidelines for students
12672,Sajjad Anwar Khokhar
12673,"Offline mode is great, but I can't 'delete all' video lectures after I finish watching them. From Asus zenfone2."
12674,I love it honestly. Just needs updating for some courses where they aren't on-demand or they are out of date. This is one of the best and most revolutionary things I have seen in education thanks.
12675,"Being working better and better there for the videos and exercises reproduction. However, the forum alerts are useless. You tap on an alert and the app sends you to the  main specialization site, no way to find where the forum alert is."
12676,I have have been out of touch from my subject since my masters in 2012 but coursera has helped me alot in keeping up with the subject or otherwise it would have been all gone .....
12677,Can't praise Coursera enough. Great app backed by one of the most important ideas of recent years.
12678,"For tablets with data access you should make the discussion questions available through the app as well. When you're on the go and want to answer it's easy just to do it from your tablet or phone app. Just a suggestion  Also, app should have a landscape mode when the tablet is hooked up to a keyboard dock or Bluetooth keyboard."
12679,Loved it....
12680,Excellent learning platform
12681,Loved it
12682,helped me alot
12683,"Slow. Seems like accessing the website directly would be faster. Always wants to be in portrait mode, constantly switches back to this mode when exiting videos. Download videos for offline use appears to be buggy. About half the time a downloaded video results in an error message. Don't try to use the ""download all"" feature, it literally tries to download them all at the same time and accomplishes nothing. But if you really want to watch videos offline I'd suggest downloading them from the website and copying them to your device."
12684,App crashes whenever video download is pressed.
12685,Audio is not good enuf. It's comparatively throws feeble voice than the audio player in the mobile.
12686,Yeppers
12687,Wharton school of business.
12688,its nice app to learn any topic.
12689,Best app
12690,Love this app and feel it is a great idea but cannot participate due to my 4G Samsung not being able to open video feed. Might have expected this on an older phone but not on this kind of model.
12691,Today I get a message that something is wrong with the videos...fix it please.
12692,No crap n to the point
12693,This is so kind of Coursera. Thank you.
12694,love it
12695,"Clearly still in beta. App doesn't do anything I actually wanted it to do, things broken etc."
12696,"Awesome app!! However, I can no longer take quizzes [Machine Learning] stopped working after week one."
12697,"Still the problem is ,it can't save videos to SD card. It continuously says try downloading again"
12698,The quizzes won't load. What's the point of learning if I can't comfort I'm doing it right? Please fix
12699,So thankful
12700,Good
12701,One of the best MOOC. Thanks for valuable courses from reputed universities
12702,Great app!
12703,A very big thanx to you guys!
12704,I couldn't log in using my email or my Facebook account!
12705,This is a efficient app.!
12706,Very good app... But I'm using it for the first time... I feel this app far better than the others... But the only drawback is a few courses are unavailable.
12707,Such nice educational supportive course era they made great revolution in online learning.thank you course era.
12708,"In the old version I was able to preload the videos, so I could watch them offline as well. Unfortunately this feature is no longer available, but it was very useful as I travel a lot. Thanks"
12709,Great but some key features are missing on Android and not everything is available in offline mode.
12710,Perfect!
12711,Osm
12712,Great courses. Have finished four so far and looking forward to do more.
12713,"I have to be online for the videos to start playing, then I can go offline. It would be nice if the app could be used completely offline (maybe except for scored quizzes)."
12714,Easy to learn.
12715,Love it. Didn't give 5 rating because there is more room for improvement.
12716,Easy to use.
12717,A wonderful platform for improvising selfskills...
12718,Knowledge mine
12719,"I'm an engineering student from Civil branch from India. I need some Course related to Civil engineering from this app .                                   few courses are still available, but they are from architectural side but most of it are present in different languages other then English.     I request please insert some building construction & transportation course in it."
12720,Very useful and user friendly
12721,"Excellent , boon for world"
12722,"Easy to use, Love the fact that you can store the videos for offline viewing. Clear & concise üôåüòä"
12723,User friendly. Ease of use. Download data to SD card is supported. Courses are good and free without certificate. Everything in one little app.
12724,the only thing missing now is the ability to play videos at variable speed
12725,"This is an inconvenience and must be worked on, otherwise good app"
12726,Works perfectly and the best education app ever
12727,You can get better your knowledge
12728,Coursera is amazing!
12729,"I really love the app, helping me find my education easy! But please how do I access the videos without using the app"
12730,you r doing good but please make a advertise for this site because most of people doesnt know about your site its awesome
12731,Just try
12732,Actually. very good
12733,This apps help me alot to learn something new out of my major as i want.  But maybe the payment process for certificate can be more easy like we buy stuff from game apps or line maybe..  Just a suggestion.  Because honestly its hard for me to pay it via PayPal
12734,It keep force closing ...I wasn't able to use it...waste of M.B and time .
12735,"O aplicativo √© muito bom, mas tem onde melhorar. Alguns conte√∫dos n√£o s√£o acess√≠veis pelo app. Um ponto ruim para mim √© que n√£o consigo trocar o local de storage para o cart√£o SD. Os v√≠deos baixados acabam ocupando muito da mem√≥ria interna e tive que remover todos os meus downloads."
12736,I can't open the videos
12737,Superb
12738,The whole thing of coursera deserves 5 star
12739,It's nice but I am not able to download videos using mobile data
12740,I find this app useful and interactive.
12741,"When I click the notification that someone replied in a thread that I follow, it just takes me to the overview of the app. I then have to manually search for the discussion to see the response. Not cool."
12742,Keep it up guys...
12743,The app is very slow and lags all the time while taking practise tests. Please look into this issue.
12744,"I really love the app , it lets me learn new skills on the go. The only problem I have faced so far is the lack of flexibility for all courses to store the downloaded videos in external storage. You can manually copy it there, but Coursera does not recognize those videos. The interface of Coursera app does play a role in giving you a feel for the course than some video player. But , else its amazing :') as they have all the courses supported by phone."
12745,Excelente oportunidad para ampliar el conocimiento en infinidad de areas profesionales y para comenzar una nueva carrera
12746,Luv to learn by it
12747,Everyone should try it
12748,Very useful
12749,"I mistakenly bought a specialization, then realized you can do everything free. They won't give return after 2 weeks despite not using any classes. Their customer support stonewalls me. They are NOT customer first org. Goof free stuff, DON'T waste your $$$"
12750,much better
12751,Useful
12752,Useful
12753,"These guys are absolutely awesome, bringing the best courses to some of the most remote places. Thanks guys, don't worry too much about the negative non constructive critism, these things will get better over time. Employers love people who can deliver, and that is what this empowers us to do."
12754,"Coursera is unbelievable.  You can take free online classes from some of the best universities in the country. I've taken several so far, and the classes are excellent. What an opportunity!"
12755,It was fine until I started noticing some classes I wanted to take cost money. Guess I'll go to udemy app instead
12756,Why do you need to access my contacts and much more other stuff on my device!?
12757,All lies. No free courses
12758,"Many times I tried to download playbacks but after minutes of downloading, nothing changed! I have to watch them all online again. Why?!"
12759,It is fast and reliable
12760,Knowledgeable app
12761,"Chromecast support is a big plus. I'll give them that. But the quality of presentation is terrible, the quiz display is so bad that they are illegible. I have to skip quizzes. Most of the coursera resources are unavailable. This app is trash."
12762,If you enjoy being repeatedly told you've no Internet when in fact it's a super buggy app then look no further!
12763,M now learning my dream course
12764,"Constantly getting oops no internet after wifi drop, even when my connection is restored."
12765,Love it
12766,The best companion for bus rides
12767,Not even in high school or middle school and easy and educational
12768,offline videos are not playing or show as downloaded although they have been
12769,Good
12770,A must have
12771,Full star
12772,"Course have to be searched, or you'll see only the paid ones."
12773,"The ""cast to"" option is not working"
12774,Best for learning
12775,Pay to enroll for any course
12776,Awesome
12777,Joy Bangla Joy Bongobondhu.
12778,Do add an option to change video quality like in the desktop version for slow internet connections
12779,Lovely and useful
12780,Very nice app. You will love this app.
12781,"There are some small problems though. For example, when I receive a notification that some user commented on a topic in the discussions and I click on that notification - the app does not lead me to the actual discussion but leaves me on root level..."
12782,Great app for learning on-the-go...!
12783,Its a very good app
12784,"There is no core structure. No suggested tier system for learning a specific topic. And once you find a class that interests you, you're most likely to get a ""coming soon"" notice without the option of being noticed once it becomes available. Very outdated app. I'm sticking to FutureLearn."
12785,Great way to stimulate the mind to new ideas and new perspectives.
12786,"The app isn't so bad, there are just a few glitches & lags now and then, and a few assignments ""say"" they can't be done on mobile phone.  This being said, I see the bugs being corrected and the app being improved very regularly and it makes me tremendously happy. Thanks to the developers, keep up the good work guys !!"
12787,Improved and better UI
12788,Bliss full

12790,Good thing
12791,Center of education
12792,"Already completed one course, and about to finish another.  No hiccups, on both Samsung,  S4 & note 10.1 2014 edition . User friendly, and has excellent course choices.  Well done  Coursera."
12793,"This is helpful,"
12794,It is very useful app that help you spend all your time in learning something New and importante
12795,Great one.
12796,Amazing tool who have a spark to learn
12797,The app is helpful since it has several courses in which one can join whatever course he/she likes.
12798,Best MOOC app out there. Ever improving. Great casting options. Very high quality courses. Couldn't do without it.
12799,"It keeps crashing on me,  can't even do a course survey on it, let alone stream a lecture 18/01/16 review update: this app is working properly again, thank you DevüòÉ"
12800,Love this so much. Thanks a lot to founders.
12801,"You should look at edX mobile app. It very fast and easy in downloading videos. Also, I can't download many videos in this app!!!"
12802,"For a busy at home mom of 3, things app is amazing! I can still work away at my education and learn, whilst I'm busy at home with the kiddies! Excellent for keeping the mind working and continued learning! It doesn't matter who you are, there's a subject you can benefit & learn from! And get thIs,,, it's free!!!! Thank you!"
12803,"Great app overall, but I need to be able to change the playback speed!"
12804,It's ok.
12805,Make it your best companian
12806,If free will be great for eveyone.
12807,"Kudos to the dev team. Before last update made it stop working on my old tablet, and few days later another update and now it works again."
12808,Very very good
12809,Superb
12810,enjoying courses on android looks great. nice ui
12811,I passionately recommend this course to everyone interested in sustaining education throughout their lives! Of any age. Any background. This course offered by Coursera is ACE!!!
12812,"This app is not free, still have to pay $$$$$$ for these online courses,!!!"
12813,Easy to use
12814,"Great app, great project !"
12815,"Good site, but the app is not that good. All those software classes and this app is all over the place, and buggy"
12816,"Totally locks my phone,  unusable"
12817,Another study point in busy life... It's good...
12818,Thank you for a very useful course in the app.
12819,So far so good! Usable with nice features and friendly interface
12820,"But it would be were worth six stars if we could access the quizzes that are in video and submit work.  The idea of using a mobile app is to be able to access this sort of content when a computer is unavailable.  Please fix this and I will surely give it five stars, I really think the content offered is worth it."
12821,Easy to access
12822,I Just love it
12823,Cannot open app. Keeps crashing.
12824,Education made easy.. Mobile classes on the go.
12825,Coursera has just set me up with a virtual classroom and learning at my own pace is just more fun than I ever imagined. Thumps up Coursera Team
12826,Good courses are free and in my pocket.
12827,Great website
12828,Simply amazing!
12829,Saved videos stopped playing. When I try to pause and play there is unsynchronized audio and video output.
12830,Killed my galaxy edge
12831,If there was some way to watch the lecture without the quiz. You must get to your phone/tablet in order to keep watching.  This is annoying!!!
12832,Great app for convenient learning
12833,Perfect
12834,"The app's request for certain permissions on Android (such as ""contacts"" and ""device and app history"") cannot be justified for the provided functionality. Please fix this so your software looks less like spyware and more like a legitimate app."
12835,Great content available!
12836,It's G
12837,Using this app for quite some time now. Wonderful app.
12838,Nice services
12839,Vvvvvvv gooooooooooodddddddddd
12840,After the last update it was just like :hey I won't get on no matter what u do!!  Seriously guys an update shoud enhance the app not turn it off with all my offline courses in!!
12841,Although I use coursera o. My computer most of the time I like that I can keep track of my progress on my phone. It's also nice that if I'm in a pinch I can get work done on here. Great as a secondary platform.
12842,This app has helped me so much w academics.
12843,Best place to find and learn anything I want
12844,"Upgrading from 4 to 5 stars now that playback speed has been added. Forum access has also been made available, basically making this a perfect app."
12845,Be yourself and make best of yourself. I'm proud of coursera
12846,Good
12847,Free...
12848,Get to continue my course no matter where I am! Little more development is needed though.
12849,"Done 2 courses,  3rd on the way.  Good delivery and ever improvingl content.  :)"
12850,Looking forward to  using this app for assignments!!!
12851,Whole world can learn from world class teachers.incredible service to the mankind.
12852,Cursera
12853,I have followed a couple of courses. A great way to learn with good examples. Very user friendly. I hope the app is as gud as the website
12854,Thanks team. This have been helpful overtime.
12855,DO NOT INSTALL... UNLESS YOU ARE RICH OR PRETTY STUPID!!!
12856,Great learning classes/ tool
12857,Very complete and good usability. The are very good courses.
12858,Great feature to download and view videos offline
12859,Better
12860,"I love Coursera, the classes, and app. It has gotten me back on the path of learning."
12861,No option to cancel downloads in progress. No straightforward way to see which videos have been downloaded (so the user can remove them to free up device storage). The user needs to go into each week of each course to see if videos have been downloaded. It'll be great if there were a way to share courses by email or messaging apps.
12862,Learning
12863,"I saved a lesson for offline viewing, but the app won't even start if I don't have a mobile signal!! [will update once fixed]"
12864,Coursera is really a great platform. I would love to appreciate the efforts of coursera team for providing such a great platform to continue advancing anyone's skills and career.
12865,"At the very least, bring back the on demand category. Now I can't tell which courses are on demand and which arent. And stop the constant updates. EDIT: Now down from 2 to 1 star due to the removal of on demand courses in favor of weekly deadlines."
12866,App crashes on launch
12867,Fails to even start. White screen folllwed by a black screena and error that app crashed. Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Android 4.3
12868,"This is a wonderful app. However, there is a ""downloads"" label before, but I can not find it recently. So, where can I fetch my downloads?"
12869,Love it
12870,Nice app
12871,Excellent app. I use my phone mostly for this app. I love it.
12872,"For some reason the photo verification is not working, everytime it says 'error in connection'. Please fix this :)"
12873,After submitting the answer quiz reopens 2 more times...please fix this
12874,"Great offering, broken downloads. The only reason I used to find the app useful was to catch up with courses while offline (train, plane, abroad), but that function isn't working anymore. I wish I could be more concrete, but all I see are spinning circles. No timeouts, no errors, just frustrating nothingness."
12875,great
12876,I want to deactivate or delete my account in Coursera.How can i do it??
12877,Great app
12878,"The app is ok, the thing I miss the most is the ability to download videos to the SD card, unthinkable to my taste."
12879,Since when do we have to pay to do the courses or receive certificates! They killed the free education vibe! Shame!
12880,It's beautiful what you do for people.
12881,"Helpful... Though m limited to some course, buh d free ones r really helpful... Can't wait 4 neuroscience to begin"
12882,Free college courses on-demand. Need I say more?
12883,Allow increased playback speed
12884,The best
12885,Not bad
12886,Awesome
12887,Really awesome app
12888,I love the app but I am not able to read mathematical expressions with it and so I can't answer my assignments and submit them
12889,Very Good app
12890,It's a good thing that it notifies about new messages in discussions. But it doesn't take you to the message when you tap on a notification. You have to find it painfully by manually browsing for it.
12891,I can't do video quizzes.
12892,Would like to download available  lecture notes tho
12893,Great App
12894,The app ha many of the website features. Still space to improve but I know you guys are working hard on this. Thanks
12895,It's easier to access and you learn alot for free. This is a win
12896,awesum platform for learning....üòÄ
12897,"Highly useful app, will get five stars when all the courses are fully working."
12898,I'm more than greatful for this.
12899,"Uninstalling. Even though it's a good app, lots of features are not available asking me to use a computer. So... Why do I have this app in the first place"

12902,"This has to be the coolest app. Great classes,  and the opportunity to learn whatever you want for free. Give thanks"
12903,"App seems to work as expected, but I lack the possibility to adjust the video speed as I do in the site. It can't be done in the app, right?"
12904,"Coursera on mobile is very useful. Having an application to go through the study materials is very much essential. Runs without any bugs, which is very important."
12905,Very nice and beneficent
12906,How to enroll courses for free?? When am enrolling it is taking me to the payment option. Please help!!
12907,this is my second installation and hope it works aas it should be this time.  I had to abort a course I was doing earlier. Hope it works !
12908,Nice ui easy to use
12909,Let me try
12910,Superb
12911,"classes are not clear, I cannot find my path easily, cannot see my progress in each class"
12912,Wonderful experience with the app
12913,It's essential to connect masses to quality education... We should encourage younger generation to use more toward their area of interest
12914,It's really like college!
12915,Sehr gut
12916,Cannot modify video playback speed or complete the quizzes on the app.
12917,I love it
12918,Excellent learning tool!
12919,Awesome work  ..
12920,It's perfect
12921,Great product for edtech enthusiasts
12922,i thought its free? why do i have to pay 100 dollars for every course
12923,Great resource to acquire knowledge. Blessings to the makers & developers.
12924,Love the idea I can take university level classes while riding the bus or in any other free time. Great app!
12925,Multiple choice questions did not render correctly so only part of the wording is visible. I will use browser instead.
12926,I'll r8 8/8 dont h8
12927,World of international education is in your pocket.
12928,Excellent
12929,its ok..
12930,"Very useful for coursera students, efficient and stable. Minor issues to improve - lecture stops after screen rotation, forums notification direct to wrong place (whole course forum instead of topic). I'd suggest also change in answering on forum - there is no vision of the post we are answering to, which might be very useful (for quotation for example). Generally: B+ :)"
12931,Thank you developers for including the downloading option for every video . This app seems to get better and better every day . I wish I could give it more than 5stars . Keep up the good work . Thank you so much for making learning so accessible to us
12932,i have been used it after being advised by professor sirlos for mathematic science university of Cambridge it is an instant software thanks coursera
12933,I update application and now it's not working..
12934,‚ò∫
12935,"Really good app, basically stable and highly useful. I'd appreciate having the in-lecture quiz questions as they are on the website, but it's a minor point. The app itself is useful and the ability to Chromecast a big plus for me."
12936,"Every few mins, app crashes...I'm unable to watch the videos at peace.. Also enable setting to download to SD card instead of only phone memory."
12937,Excellent learning
12938,One of my dreams came true...
12939,Cool learning
12940,All courses are very very useful and informative. Learn from anywhere anytime
12941,"Thanks for making our learning experience easier. One comment while exploring course outline, it appears only in portrait layout, although I use landscape position."
12942,It helped me very much! Thanks!
12943,I like the coursera app
12944,Incredible app.
12945,This app is amazing! You can learn anything you want.
12946,After update it don't works at all
12947,It's really complete. I can do almost everything without going to the website. It's super superior to the edX app. Thanks Coursera.
12948,The application was working very well before but suddenly it is not playing videos. My internet is working perfectly fine. There is something wrong with the app.  Please fix it.
12949,"I love the course content from all the major Higher learning centers,but the android app had problems with photo verify and i had to take of the courses several times before it verified making the experience very frustrating"
12950,Galaxy S6.
12951,Better
12952,Takes about three minutes to load a course since the update. That is a very unreasonable time frame. Nexus 7 user.
12953,This is a great way to keep learning even when you can't afford college.
12954,Simply the best
12955,I like the coursera app. It lets me look in on courses and view lectures. I haven't been able to use it for other functions like exams though--at least on my android phone.
12956,"A  Professor st the Univ of Chicago told me about Coursera a few years ago.  I have taken several courses and did very well.  My next challenge is to complete a Certificate Program and in my opinion it is similar to completing a Graduate level program. The work, assignments can be challenging but you will be pleased in the end."
12957,Great  app for Android  . Thanks
12958,The app doesn't even opens most of the time.. I have to try atleast 3-4 times to open it up.. Plzz fix.
12959,If you will try this app you will definitely think that it deserves 5 star. And thank you very much coursera.
12960,Repeating error makes phone unusable. Had to uninstall.
12961,One of the best educational apps available but need to refine video playback and audio-video syncing
12962,The sound and video are out of sync. This is am important issue. Other than that beautifully designed.
12963,Images don't load on the tests pretty often which requires that you guess the answer. Would change to 5 stars if this was fixed
12964,Has got everything i need to know...keep it up
12965,The best way to learn new things from great professor
12966,i cant download video please help
12967,Great thing..
12968,not bad
12969,Useful app
12970,"Works great if you live in the Silicon Valley with permanent & fast internet connection. :-P The app however is entirely unusable on a stuttering internet connection: Screens stay blank even when videos are available offline. If the device is completely offline (airplane mode), the cached videos work, though. Too bad that quizzes cannot be used offline."
12971,Excellent
12972,Bhai log use it man
12973,It's common platform for the learners.
12974,"You guys can't find these kind of apps at any store....Wordless to say, such a lovely design for the online learning arena."
12975,what are u want...available here
12976,"There are almost no free courses. The app description is deliberately vague and misleading. If you're going to charge for most of your courses, you should at least mention that."
12977,Last time I used this app they had lots of free courses. Now it seems every single one is now payment. Disappointing. From 5* to 1*
12978,It's so useful to thus students who are  interested to learning in online......
12979,I dont know why but it cant open recently on my phone (moto g 1st gen)
12980,I love it because i can take my coursera courses on my phone
12981,There are bugs in downloading and besides those bugs the Downloaded videos aren't properly managed. By the name of the file its not possible to understand that which video belongs to which course. Naming system should be improved and the if the files could be downloaded within the course wise different directories then it will be much helpful
12982,Great App
12983,"Video is laggy after last update. Freezes, and after that becomes unsynchronized with the audio. Please fix ASAP."
12984,The app is ok but I find it difficult to watch videos. Fix
12985,"I am having problems with video, audio and subtitles unmatched."
12986,Video playback problems.
12987,It's a great app with a user friendly and smooth hassle free UI. Great platform. But I'd really appreciate it if i could download the videos so that i could watch them anytime anywhere.
12988,Great app for beginners
12989,"App is not connecting to Internet now. It freezes when it needs to connect. Tried reinstalling, now I can't even log in. UPDATE: FINALLY, LOGGED IN TODAY. EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE NOW"
12990,Best app for open courses
12991,Not working since I updated it
12992,Helps you learn almost anything.. but in a very systematic manner.. great app
12993,"Brilliant app for learning different subjects at one place.It really helped me in fields like  micro and macroeconomics,learn how to learn,financial accounting and many others.loved it."
12994,No free courses in the current version
12995,"I love this site since last 2 years, high quality content, dedicated staff. No words to explain."
12996,Unstable after new update...
12997,Helpfull for engineers
12998,likz
12999,There is an issue when not being able to input negative numeric value as answer which leads you  to auto-fail that answer
13000,It's simply the best app to learn anything ‚ò∫üëç
13001,"I loved the app very much. I dont have a very stable broadband connection and all the methods i tried to batch download videos didnt work.This app solves those problems-up to an extend. But the problem i am facing now is , my mobile doesnt really have much storage space and the naming of the video files is insane.Is there any way to transfer the downloaded videos to my computer with file names that can be easily identified. Again great Job with the app."
13002,Some of the best courses offered by best minds
13003,I can't open the app after the update.
13004,The app worked fine and I have enrolled for 2 courses but after update the app is not responding and not able to continue the course. Not able to open the application at least.
13005,Fix it please.
13006,The last update made video playback much worse. They removed the speed feature and now you have to touch the device every few minutes to prevent screen lock.
13007,The Application is crashing as soon as I open it.
13008,Good app for learning ))
13009,It's a dead app now. Not been able to open. Crashing as soon as I try to open. Fix it asap. Major bug

13016,Hi guys. Ever since the new update I have not been able to open any of the courses without my phone crashing. Please fix
13017,becoz this helped me by many sides
13018,When video is playing the phone dims and then trns screen off. It didn't do that before. Fix
13019,"I really enjoy taking classes through Coursera, but the app needs help. We need to be able to ""verify"" through it and you can't, not initially and not for test/quizzes {they all need to be done through a web browser}; you can't view or upload projects through it; can't tap on the camera to ""focus"" on your subject. You're very limited on what can be accomplished with it, mainly reading and viewing most vids, but not all; playback is spotty. The app crashes often."
13020,Loved it
13021,The app is great n coursera is doing great but the problem I have is that the app is just terminating by itself unexpectedly. Please help fix this.
13022,"I've been going through hell with both the app and the website, the website wouldn't even load and the app keeps crashing every time I open a video, please try to fix this coz I'm missing a lot of deadlines here."
13023,Education has never been so democtatic and free
13024,"It would be great if the app could open external links in system default browser (e.g. Chrome) rather than trying to display content itself. Mobile view is not working, neither is zoom."
13025,Amazing.
13026,In site i registered using facebook but in app i am not having that option please fix it.
13027,While waiting for my new tv ...ill be glad to take advantage. Of your latest deal..... 6 galaxy brought to me. ...but as i said.  I still want my new tv ok.  Thankyou very much !.....Lou
13028,Free to learn and you can learn anywhere! Awesome!
13029,Awesome
13030,Playback rerror is not yet fixed on my samsung note pro.
13031,Good
13032,The application is very good it helped me a lot but the problem is that it stops unexpectedly many times. That's why I have given 4 stars
13033,The video dose not work with me even with my personal computer
13034,⁄©ÿßÿ±ŸÖŸà ÿ≤ŸàÿØ ÿßŸÜÿ¨ÿßŸÖ ŸÖ€åÿØŸáÿØ
13035,Coursera  rocks but app so so
13036,"I don't know what happened with the last updated, I like the program and for me is really easy take the class outside because I work all day"
13037,Andriod app doesn't support pop up questions asked during the video lectures.
13038,Its annoying when i cannot turn off notifications for chats for different courses. My mobile notification bar is ever over loaded...
13039,I can't understand why when I'm reading some of my course lectures and then I rotate my phone to be more comfortable I always appear in the main menu and lost all the progress... That makes me don't want to use this app anymore
13040,Just exactly what i needed
13041,"Completely applicable, spreading knowledge thus peace"
13042,
13043,Fun to learn
13044,The sound of the videos does not work anymore. Please fix.
13045,Great courses easy to follow
13046,Also PDF links and others lecture links can not be opened in Coursera app. It is not even possible to open it in an external browser.
13047,"Sorry, its ok"
13048,Skips ever second video and there is no possibility to adjust the video speed.
13049,It's almost merely a video player compared to the rich and full experience you get on the website.
13050,Coursera helps you in seeking out...
13051,"I often go back to taking the course on the browser. I like the in - video quizzes because it helps me retain information and concepts better. However, quizzes are not available in app."
13052,Must be there in everyone's phone
13053,Updated and felt disappointed. It just keeps loading. Confusing.
13054,Application is too heavy and need to be improved.  The launching time is high and require you to be too patient. But we need to learn with coursera and we will use it. Application need to be improved.
13055,Good
13056,This application seems to be the best use of Internet. I just wonder how they are able to give such valuable content for free. Great work developers and the whole team of coursera.
13057,"It always says ""Unfortunately coursera has stopped!"" Fix this please. I don't know what the problem is. It sucks!"
13058,Very good
13059,A recent update has broken the save video offline feature. Some videos get saved and some don't! And I can't control which videos to select for download again.
13060,Must Have.
13061,Nice for learning
13062,What the hell? I enrolled in some courses.. They seem to name dissapeared.. No option to find them... Fix asap.. Samsung s6
13063,"In some quiz . when i want to do someone , in questios the tenses are incomplete, so, i can't answer the questios because i don't have all infotmation."
13064,I've uninstalled and reinstalled several time. The blue circle of death does not cease.
13065,Recent updates fixed a lot of lingering UX problems.
13066,"Logging into coursera is always a time to learn something new,thank you for the good work."
13067,Why to give an option to download videos offline when the app is not working without Internet connection?
13068,Useful app
13069,Better to take class on a computer and not mobile phone. The profs put up links you cant click on with the phone. Otherwise nice to watch the lectures.
13070,Love
13071,Awsm app
13072,The app is fine. But nothing is free.
13073,Fantastic concept
13074,"I need to send my ID pic for Specialization course. But the camera function of the app lacks in auto-focus, so I can't! There is no ""contact us"" to let them know. How frustrating!"
13075,No option to download specific videos that failed
13076,Grrreaaat
13077,If you love to learn or just want to refresh your mind.
13078,Excellent app!
13079,Great app for accessing my courses on the go.
13080,"With coursera app for Android I can learn on the go. The offline download option it's great. There is a problem of taking quiz, the quiz isn't load."
13081,This app is great. And it really help me to watch lectures anywhere any time. But add deadline to calender is not working.
13082,Learning made enjoyable
13083,Loving coursera since day 1
13084,Love it.
13085,Great tool for learning wherever you are!!!
13086,Good
13087,Does not eork
13088,Useful for all kinds of people who loves to learn.
13089,Fantastic
13090,Very nice app
13091,Most of the time I can't watch any videos! It just shows the pending icon forever.
13092,What happened to the on-demand courses?
13093,Awesome app
13094,Perfect for my classes
13095,"After the latest update, the app no longer shows my courses, and sometimes won't load at all over a WiFi connection. Everything works fine over cellular. Samsung Note 5 and Note Pro tablet. Any chance this can be fixed?"
13096,"Very good, learning at your finger tips"
13097,thanks alot for this app it's very nice
13098,"""Saving to the SD card is not supported on this device."" Coolpad 3230A on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. Pretty stupid that it's even a problem. Does the developer ever read these reviews?"
13099,Offline mode isn't working any more
13100,lovin it
13101,Really love this app
13102,"Cant watch videos on my phone, its only sound and in many lectures visuals are of some importance. Five stars otherwise"
13103,Video doesn't play
13104,appreciate
13105,Still have to be improved but it's great now
13106,Thanks to all team for making this amazing app
13107,"Needs to support inline quizzes, like the web site, in offline mode. The inline quizzes really help comprehension and retention."
13108,I used to love taking classes because they were free. Now every class is 50 or higher. Will no longer use app. It used to  be fun just to learn for free no pressure about grades or wasting my money.
13109,A believe z gonna make sense
13110,"I used this app a year ago and absolutely loved it. Being able to speed through lectures that sometimes dragged a little too slow was great. Unfortunately, this feature has been removed and replaced with a large number of bugs, including: issues when switching being portrait and landscape views, video players not playing in the screen size unless downloaded, and pages not loading. I love the concept, but this is a pretty big step back."
13111,"There's an extremely frustrating bug while casting where often the video will also start playing on my phone. To stop the copy playing on my phone and only have it playing on my chromecast I have to stop casting, pause, start casting again (wait...), and play again. This seems to often happen with the second video that plays or if I don't get the timing exactly right as to when pressing cast."
13112,To be a perfect programmer
13113,This app is amazing.i love it so much.
13114,Best of e learning app
13115,App constantly crashes with Chromecast
13116,Loked it
13117,This app is very good
13118,After playing the video..within a minute application get crashes..please look into this asap
13119,An excellent app
13120,"M forced to give 2 stars as Video player is not able to fit inside the screen width of my phone,  thus i can able to see only the half size of the video . Please fix this problem ASAP... ."
13121,Working normally after the update and the learning content is great. Hoping to see more learning material in future. And maybe add some language learning too.
13122,I have to uninstall and reinstall the app every week (literally) to watch the videos. Please fix. Sprint Samsung Galaxy S5.
13123,I love it
13124,Can't get past first quiz in calculus.   Freezing up
13125,"Finally, you can binge learn on a specific topic. This is great."
13126,My course dashboard disappeared. Do we call such things as update?
13127,I am using remix os on my Chuwu HI8. I cannot able to open the app after sign in. Feeling bad.
13128,I like you...
13129,The recent upgrade has cleared all of my enrolled courses. There is no way to navigate to any enrolled courses.  I can only browse the catalog.  Please fix. Otherwise a great app (before this upgrade)
13130,"It's a nice app, great courses"
13131,Through a web browser there is the option for q&a in the middle of a video. With this app this function is missing.
13132,I like it
13133,Thank you.
13134,"I had used Coursera for a few courses before discovering the android app. What a fantastic complement to the computer! Now I can reclaim my commute and check assignments on the fly, saving even the few minutes to get the laptop out makes this incredibly useful."
13135,This is the most amazing app ever made for the education sector.
13136,Thank you Coursera :)
13137,Now I can educate myself in bed. :)
13138,"The concept deserves a 100 stars. I am giving the app 4 stars only because the video does not support playback speed (like in the web version). Please incorporate that. Other than that, anybody can have access to immense knowledge in the most refined way."
13139,This app is a tribute to human ingenuity and the desire to bring education to all. Works beautifully.
13140,Also some functions work better in browser.
13141,The best MOOC provider. ..but a miner problem is coursera app not moving offline stuff to removable media (SD) I tried it but it is still in my phone's internal memory. Team please solve it as earlier as possible.  Thanks
13142,Sometimes the videos do not get played. Please improve this.
13143,Awesome
13144,"This app used to work on my tablet just fine but for some reason, it has stopped showing the courses that I'm signed up for.  The app on my phone works fine and shows all the courses I'm signed up for as well as all the content of said courses."
13145,"Freezes, crushes all the time. Every time I use it, I end up going to the browser again. Not satisfied at all."
13146,Saved videos for offline viewing but I can not view the videos unless I have connection to the Internet. I have checked and the video are there when i navigate to them using vlc but with out internet the app fails to load the course and repeatedly crashes
13147,Cool
13148,Great but it will be brilliant if I can learn with more videos
13149,I loved the save for offline feature
13150,Gooood
13151,Why I can't reach my posts in the discussion??. I prefer the web site.
13152,really helpfull... ty deelopers üòçüòò
13153,Good app for finding project or any important things
13154,Is a great app. All the courses are on my fingertouch. But the UI can be more user friendly.
13155,I felt obliged to install this app because always popping full screen when starting my course. App give much less than direct connection and it is not possible to download documents. Desinstall and forget
13156,Noticed the battery drain was greater after i had downloaded courses for offline viewing.
13157,"This app was great about two months ago when I used it to take a free and open poetry course. Now there is no way to enroll in the Interactive Design course, without first paying for it, which contrasts one of the initial claims in the description for the app."
13158,"The app is mostly good, makes it easy to view videos even offline. But it only opens the course resources and reading in its crippled browser and you can get those links out. Can't share or even copy/paste. Have to go to course in normal browser for that."
13159,Loved it
13160,How can I download videos for offline watching
13161,Videos don't load since last update
13162,Plz fix it
13163,Good App ever
13164,"And optional paid certificate, which as courses go is fairly inexpensive."
13165,"After installing the latest update, I can't play the video at all on my samsung galaxy note 3"
13166,Bad apps even the course good
13167,Some videos do not open.
13168,It's the concept of edx what makes this app great. It's just well done.
13169,Is amazing i like this
13170,There are many courses to improve your brain.
13171,I love this app
13172,It give us beneficial things to know it.......... thanks a lot
13173,I can study everywhere
13174,"In my humble opinion, Coursera is the best MOOC provider online today. The courses are taught by experienced instructors who have access to the most up to date information possible. Use the courses to challenge yourself and broaden your outlook on the global community. You can pay for certification, but it's not necessary if you just want to learn. Nothing beats free knowledge. You won't be disappointed."
13175,"First it crashed every time on start-up after I logged in. Then I relogged and crashes stopped but now I can't see any of my current courses, only recommended. Been using the previous version and it worked pretty well. HTC 820, android 4.4.2"
13176,Its so good
13177,This is for improve my English and Educations!
13178,Very nice
13179,App works well. Makes learning on a mobile or tablet very easy
13180,No auto-focus of the Camera when taking photo of ID card for the Submit Government ID section in the Certify part. Please fix this so that I could submit my assignments. I'm using Z1 Compact and Z5 Compact (both running Android 5. 1)
13181,All you guys having issues. Buy a better phone. What do you expect?
13182,"Please improve this app. I use it on my Google nexus 6 and it is very slow, freezing periodically. It is not user friendly. I prefer to use the online website!"
13183,Great
13184,"Great app.  But I cant cast subtitles, along with the video to my TV via chromecast.  Though subtitles work fine while watching on phone.  Please fix it.,"
13185,Are the in-video quizs available offline yet?
13186,I'm running Android 6.0 and this app crash after each video finishes and when you try to change any playback setting
13187,Superb
13188,"Bad performance, not updating stats in time, not validating"
13189,"This error ""unfortunately, Coursera has stoped"" always pop up."
13190,Awesome learning tool
13191,"Learned about the free training by the top star universities via this app. Mark you they are short courses, offered free, and you get a certificate at the end of it. Several courses are available for everyone. This is my bookmark. Great App"
13192,Love it
13193,"I haven't had the video loading difficulties others have reported. Works fine for me, and I can send videos to Chromecast, which is great. Drops a star because it doesn't always pick up module progress properly after watching a video. But happy so far!"
13194,This app seems to get only worse. It's super heavy and it takes a lifetime loading the course I already downloaded to watch
13195,Very Good platform to increase and share knowledge
13196,"I'm downloading it now, hope it's worthy"
13197,Great courses
13198,Chromecast support would get 5 stars.
13199,Awsome!!!!!
13200,I picked log in with facebook and it just tells me i'm already logged in and asks me to log in again.
13201,Must download
13202,"Absolutely horrible app, hate it."
13203,"Website is so good, and the app so bad.. I myself can create a better application.. There is no provision for viewing the course record nor for editing stuff. Come on coursera u deserve a better app"
13204,Won't play the videos anymore!
13205,The app takes quite long to load and sometimes it  loads content from another course I have already taken. It needs some work. It is probably slow because its written in Java LOL
13206,Keep sharing knowledge ‚ù§
13207,Best for learning
13208,The videos do not load anymore
13209,"The app won't access my account or any of my courses on my Samsung Tab. The wheel turns for several minutes until the app crashes. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted, logged out and in many times. Happy to change my rating later if I can get it to work...at all."
13210,Better on line
13211,Project Assistant

13213,"First, it loads the text for like 10 minutes (no video, and I'm on fast connection). Then if I turn my phone on the side, it reloads the page again (for 10 minutes). Also, I wanted to write a post in discussions, and after a wrote a couple of paragraphs, the ""post"" button disappeared, and the text I wrote couldn't be copied! Such a waste of time. Coursera, please fire the contractor who made this app."
13214,Videos won't load. Makes the app useless.
13215,"This application is really what Nigeria needs, free and educational. I personally love this app!!! The the work Coursera gat going on"
13216,"I love the courses, but the videos frequently won't play properly.  This is problematic."
13217,Takes so much time...just to display the first page when you view a course. Please improve the performance.
13218,"This app is terrible, with poor design, infinite loading time for most subpages, no access to my current courses. Do not recommend."
13219,Its sooo slow.
13220,"I use cursera all the time to learn about machine learning. The app is great, allows downloads of the video lessons and makes the homework tasks available."
13221,Great!!!
13222,A superb app to learn about approximately every field with best teaching resources.
13223,I cannot find the free courses anymore. When I browse the catalog all i see are the ones with fees. there is no filter to find courses per school or free version. using samsung s4
13224,"..it's Coursera, they're a bloody nuisance. Sign up and you will be bombarded with emails. 'We have courses you will be interested in', they boast. I'm doing philosophy, they're peddling business studies. Bugger off and leave me alone."
13225,You will simply love this app.
13226,"I'm an avid Coursera fan.  The lectures and coursework are generally superior to those provided in person at college, and I turn to it to supplement every subject I study.  I've paid for 6+ courses, and participated in more than two dozen.  I recommend it to everyone.  That said, after two years, a complete redesign, and 3 mobile devices on my part, the app is still hopelessly broken.  Resources fail to load more often than they work, breaking the only essential use case, watching lectures on the go."
13227,If you want to do it yourself over an app. This is it!
13228,Every time I open the application it takes too long to load all the details about a particular course. Please do fix it.
13229,Love it
13230,"Also I no longer can access a free course I started, now you want me to pay?? Adi√≥s, Coursera, uninstalling, unsub'ing."
13231,Course outline (eg. the ML course) takes a really loong time (20s) to load over Wifi (802.11n). Phone is Nexus 6p.
13232,Very useful thanks:)
13233,Perfect
13234,I upgraded this app to latest version. After the upgrade I'm not able to locate earlier downloaded videos from the app.
13235,I can't watch any of the course videos. I wish it could be fixed.
13236,"Now I learning one course. I see it as active on main page. But after I get in I see only Outline tab. After waiting I see Discussions tab. After another waiting I see certify tab. Why wait, and where course tab? Actually I finished one week of my course already."
13237,Perfect MOOC app!
13238,"I have an Experia Z3, none of the videos will play. My phone eventually just goes to sleep. Please fix. üò¢"
13239,Why does it need a new permission to access my calendar when the changes are just fixes and perf improvements?
13240,Stability decreased
13241,"The app itself could use some enhancements, but I can't advocate Coursera enough."
13242,Absolutely love it. But please fix bugs
13243,Love  the add to calendar feature
13244,"very good app, but today after update I can't save my course for offline view on sd card. got message: saving to sd card is not supported on this device."
13245,"Why am i supposed to write my email and name again even if i am logged in? And where is the ""My Courses"" section?"
13246,"Good for big data, technology"
13247,Gud
13248,I can do this prior to the most recent app update. I hope this can be resolved soon.
13249,What a great idea
13250,Liked it
13251,I use the app from my android phone. It worked great but I have met difficulties with the video loading for month already. I can not use the app practically. Probably we need an update and I hope to get it soon.
13252,Learning new skills is easier now. I like the offline option which will let you watch videos later.
13253,This app works fine but there is lot bugs to be fixed
13254,Great App.
13255,But it sadly is not free. Can't take any courses without them trying to get into your bank account. Just another scam.
13256,When is it finally going to be possible to cast to chromecast with subtitles?
13257,"Smooth, well organized and nice UI."
13258,This apps always love you
13259,Ocean of knowledge
13260,"I can't find ""my courses"" section, and the course catalogue is frozen/will not load"
13261,Best lesson s
13262,Great way to learn new things.
13263,Love it
13264,No video
13265,"I really enjoyed it, until I couldn't load videos any more! Please, fix it!"
13266,For those who seek creative learning
13267,Crashes every time while casting.
13268,Works great
13269,I like it. Very nice plZ join it
13270,Wonderful
13271,The app keeps freezing so I'm not able to access my course and it is very frustrating
13272,I have been working on one course which I was enrolled in and after the update that course was removed from my list and it is in a fee-based section now. This is frustrating. Where did the open source education system go?
13273,Just Love it
13274,Works great
13275,"A good app no longer works as it should? What exactly was ""fixed?"""
13276,Alot of bugs.
13277,I am learning so much about practically any desired knowledge I have. Referred to me by my college advisor! Now I get college level practice before the big game.
13278,ÿπÿßŸÑ€å
13279,Good app
13280,"Videos are unable to be played and problematic especially when saved for offline. The ""My Downloads"" never show any of my saved videos. App is also stuck trying to load sometimes."
13281,"It generally works pretty good, but I cannot do the biweekly assignments from the phone and apparantly my course progress is not the same if I go on the web."
13282,Ver cool app
13283,I was able to listen to lectures at lunch and use my phone a Galaxy S6 to take exams . My computer does not have a web cam so I am VERY dependent on the app. HELP!!! I now have problems loading anything. I love the app when its working.
13284,Superb app for basic approach of technologies
13285,Very helpful
13286,"It says free online courses, but every class I looked at costs money to enroll in."
13287,"Nothing works anymore, so the app is now pointless."
13288,Free study
13289,"Was working fine for weeks but someone has apparently decided to ""improve"" it.  Now I cannot find the Week 4 videos for UoW Machine Learning that I already downloaded and watched once.  Today all I get is pictures of the instructors and a description of what the week is supposed to cover.  This is not going to be much help trying to learn the material for this week's assignment.  Doesn't anyone test this stuff?"
13290,THIS APP SCREWED MY FINAL EXAM! and my PAID CERTIFICATE!
13291,I love this
13292,Loved this app. After latest update I open the app and all of my classes are gone. What happened?  UPDATE: Thanks for the speedy fix.
13293,"Wish all courses appeared the same in app, Intro to interactive programming in python I am looking at you."
13294,The best way to learn online..üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
13295,Can learn many things
13296,"Downloading the course is to learn when there is no connectivity. But coursera doesn't allow me to do so, it needs internet connectivity to login. It's terrible."
13297,Updated app recently and now it doesn't even open
13298,"When it works, the app is amazing. However, some videos just never load. Sometimes the modules themselves never load. Sometimes (very often)  the quizzes for math don't load the equations properly but rather some math formatting code. I've waited upwards of ten minutes for a 3 question calculus quiz to load"
13299,"Recently I haven't been able to use this app because it no longer (at least not on my Samsung Galaxy S6) supports logging in with FB, and I don't have email login credentials and also can't set up email login even when I go to the Coursera website. Very sad and frustrated that I can no longer reach my classes on my phone. Help? I loved this app when I was using it on my old Alcatel-Lucent Fierce and could actually log in."
13300,Now I can study wherever and whenever I want! The nerd's dream:D
13301,Great app! You can access moocs from your phone
13302,Couldn't use it even once.
13303,It's very nice
13304,"App is working now, thanks for the fast update"
13305,"Videos not scaling properly, and the app seems to ""call home"" on its own even if not running. Thank you, but no."
13306,"I was really enjoying my classes but now after the update I can't even get the app to load! All I get is a white screen with the spinning wheel. 30 mins and still no data showing! I'm missing out on my classes and I'm over a week behind on 2 of them! Help!!!        Update as of 10/10; I tried the new update, still nothing but a white screen. Uninstalling. You would think a company with so many complaints would at least respond to some of them."
13307,"It works fine, but changes in your profile are not always changed in the app."
13308,Download those tutorial videos isn't easy pls work on the inbuilt browser or downloader as the case may be
13309,"This does not work at all.  Earliew all my videos play fine but now it does not even show me a course if i am on wifi.  My even slower 2g connection shows me courses but the courses i applied to earlier are gone.  Only those which are completed are shown. I will wait till next update.  If it doesnt get fixed,  i would rather uninstall it and use youtube instead."
13310,Update worst
13311,I cant do anything. I start it and it freezes and crashes.
13312,"Edit: I updated to see if that would solve the problems, but now it's even worse! Nothing works on my droid maxx. Slow, freezes constantly, and it's difficult to navigate. This app used to be great and now it is unusable."
13313,Very good app
13314,"It's pretty nice to be able to download lectures and watch them on the bus or whenever, but I really, really need the option to increase the play speed. Some professors take forever to get to the point, and mobile devices don't really lend themselves for fine tuned control of the play bar."
13315,Thats good
13316,Zaidizaidi9926
13317,Useful! Awesome....
13318,This app just keeps getting better. Chromecast experience is now great.
13319,"After logging in, nothing loads. All you see is a spinning animation."
13320,Good app
13321,"When it starts, it shows blank screen.  When I tried to refresh by pulling down gesture,  it shows updating circle forever.  When I tried search,  it complaints of ""no connection"", while the other applications work fine including Google Play.  I'm using it from China.    It was working quite well until October 1st, 2015.  It's indispensable for my study with the offline feature that I am eagerly wish it returns to its past glory. On October 7, 2015, I found that the problem reported above is gone. It seems that the server side of Coursera's app might have improved, or fixed.  Thanks!"
13322,Dr B
13323,"Atrocious app from a ""learning provider"" that counts android development as one of its main subjects. What's the point in being able to save material for offline viewing if the bloody thing tries to load at every opportunity. It will even start trying to load the page again on rotating the screen. Shame, as it looks quite nice. UPDATE: now I even get two loading circles at the same time!"
13324,Filled a gap!
13325,Initiallly I was able to watch all videos but all of a sudden no new videos are playing. Everytime I click on a video to play it says can't play video Its really disappointing as the application was really working nicely for me.For now I m reinstalling to check if issue is resolved
13326,Amazing
13327,Too bad looking for a Spanish class and none available.
13328,Love the app!
13329,No flaws! Woohoo!
13330,"At first i could access my courses,now with the update they videos are no longer playing.its not my internet connection. Feeling very frustrated because im behind"
13331,"I like the app, but there are many things to be improved.  It bugs when I am using the offline mode and very often it wouldn't load the saved videos. Also, the videos themselves are too big, and all of a sudden I have 4GB memory used by 3 courses."
13332,"I love Coursera, and this app wad great when I first started, but now it won't play any of the course videos on my phone."
13333,Can't play the videos..
13334,Good aap
13335,Excellent app for students
13336,Awesome helps me alot...especially in chemis
13337,Total crap
13338,"I've been unable to load a single page within this app for several weeks. The website can be opened in mobile browser, and videos are available there, and they can be played without any playback issues, but the app keeps showing the loading indicator for minutes, and the content is actually never loaded. This is very annoying."
13339,Nice app please download it....
13340,Crash while watching a video..  Worked well before.
13341,Ok üëå
13342,üëåüëç
13343,It hangs a lot. I can't skip a part of the video. It results in crashing. Pelvis version was much better. And why is there no bifurcation between on demand courses and present courses?
13344,Problem when saving videos offline
13345,"This is a very invasive app. It spies on my contacts, my browsing activity, my camera."
13346,Many of the course videos wont play- they buffer endlesly
13347,"It's an okay application. But I'm not able to download videos on my SD card. That's a very important feature for me so that i would be available to access it offline. Anyway, keep up the good work."
13348,"This app is broken. Have watched several videos and answered many quizzes, none of which shows up as being completed."
13349,Nice
13350,This is a great and very useful App for people interested in knowing everything in a cost-free way. CONGRATULATIONS
13351,nice work
13352,is there psycologie domain ??
13353,Great app but need some improvement as it crash very frequently on my MotoE device
13354,Video does not load. Sometimes video start playing in background while you are using other applications.
13355,Sucks
13356,"When i first downloaded the app it was great and i was about to give it a 5 star review. It updated 2 days ago and I haven't been able to open the app since. I was really enjoying the courses, everything was so well done and laid out.  I feel that i had gained a lot from Coursera and i wish i could keep going. Hopefully a new upgrade will come out soon, although if my classes close before it happens I doubt I will resign up for them."
13357,Gracias por esta aplicaci√≥n!
13358,App won't even open now.
13359,I like it. It makes my work simple
13360,Nice..  but Data science!!
13361,This cousera is really helpful and I enjoy it very much. But it'll really fun if the subtitle can work effectively.  Why does the subtitles can't show up and keeps saying that error. So I hope you make better improvement and thank you for this app !
13362,"But that is not saying much. I like the direction the app and website are going (5 stars if everything worked properly), but there are A LOT of bugs to work out. The app hangs often (non-stop spinning circle). The only solution I have found is to force quit and try again. When it works, loading is still pretty slow. Some permissions seem unreasonable, but you can switch those off with Marshmallow (preview)."
13363,"I haven't found any issues with the app, though I don't use it a ton because I'm busy. I don't quite understand all the permissions, but they must be for reasons."
13364,"This app asks for a lot of rights, so many that I'm wonder if it is better to drop Coursera due to this. Access to my contacts? Righs to download files without notifying me? Seriously? This feels creepy..."
13365,Nice
13366,Nice
13367,This is app better.thanks
13368,For long i had been in search of open course app thanks coursera
13369,Very usfull app
13370,Not free
13371,Gracias!!!!!
13372,"Forever student, staying relevant and self development. I'm intrigued with how far my growth will take me."
13373,Im just getting started
13374,"When will app developers realise that internet connections are unreliable? I give up using this if my internet connection is unstable as it constantly tries to load. Also, how does the offline  mode work? How do I get it to continue downloading as it does not seem to do it automatically? I have lectures in various states of download. I much prefered being able to choose which lectures to download rather than the app choosing for me."
13375,Rewarding website!! Deserves more than 5 stars
13376,This is an incredible application
13377,Thanks for your hard work
13378,I do not know all apps on my tab open except ot keep downloading with very little progress . The version before was much much good than this one now . What can i do ????
13379,All the course content cannot be accessed on the app and all courses can't be verified.
13380,Thanks to coursera to make my study easy....once again thank you.
13381,"Chromecast support is great; however, my lessons aren't being marked as watched when using this feature."
13382,wonderful courses for free
13383,"WHY DO YOU NEED ALL THESE PERMISSIONS, MY CONTACTS,  MY HISTORY, REALLY? How many fall for this? NO THANKS CAMERA!WHY DO YOU NEED MY CAMERA... To spy..sick *@#+~%"
13384,The streaming of the videos are really slow.
13385,Love it
13386,Nice app. Keeps everything intact. Love the organization too. Thumbs up Team Coursera.
13387,This app makes learning easy and simple
13388,Works great and I really like the content
13389,Videos never load
13390,Some of the videos take 3-5 minutes to load and you can't always see your quizzes at the end of the video.  So then you have to switch back to the desktop.
13391,–ù–∞—Ä–µ—à—Ç—ñ —Ç—Ä–æ—Ö–∏ –±–∞–≥—ñ–≤ –ø–æ–≤–∏–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è–ª–∏ :)
13392,Can get updated about the latest advancements..
13393,There's just 1 problem that the pop-up question are not visible in mobile app.
13394,Best info app for all kind of students download it and get informed well
13395,The apps jumps between videos not following the program correctly
13396,I really enjoy to use this app!
13397,Subtitles are showed on device while streaming to Chromecast
13398,I'm wondering why I see listing dated 2014 and is it ok to try to join in?
13399,"Thanks for coursera team and all universities participating, from the bottom of my heart for gathering all the knowledge in the world at one place."
13400,It's nice that even when I'm not at home I'm able to access my course information. Clear picture just like on my laptop.
13401,It'd be great if we could use phone's webcam for verification. I have a desktop with no webcam.
13402,Would be great to be able to speed up videos like in the browser.
13403,"This used to be a five star app for me. I can no longer download videos for offline viewing. This is a big problem for someone like me who is limited on their data, can't stream, and therefore at the mercy of downloading videos via free WiFi. PLEASE FIX!!!"
13404,Thanks for adding option to move to SD card. It would have been better if you could have name the video files appropriately and categorised them to appropriate folders.
13405,That's what this MOOC is all about.
13406,Love it
13407,Love it!
13408,Except some missed subtitles..
13409,Crashes after signup
13410,When you try to enroll in a course it trys to charge you 50+ dollars to acess materials. Not cool. Thought this would be a study guide. Already paying for school. Not going to take a unacredited class on my phone....
13411,I wish I could save courses in one place that I'm interested in.
13412,"I just filled the information to sign up, and when logging in the app crashed, and its the same everytime I open it. Please fix it!"
13413,Awesome
13414,One of the greatest app Learn like you wer to live 4ever
13415,"Courses are amazing but the app experience is not that great. Loading is very slow, and the app needs a serious upgrade(specially in the UI area)."
13416,All the menus glitch and the course exercises disappear if the screen rotates.  Using Chrome instead...
13417,Wont let me play some quizzes on my tablet. Once letting me complete and verify the  quiz before erroring and then saying not available on  tablet. Constant problems with viewing my homepage and courses. Problems downloading courses to my phone. If you fixed the bugs this would be my favourite  app!
13418,"I guess this is for people who want to take tests and peer review each other... And enroll in courses. I just want the content to watch and read. Oh well, back to Plex and Books."
13419,Must have it while in college
13420,"I can't see the General Course Pages. This app used to be awesome, with videos and awesome content. Please bring back the first versions!"
13421,Superb
13422,Helpful
13423,since the site was redesigned i can no longer do anything useful with this app.  i can't see videos/assignments etc.  it works ok via Chrome (although the new layout is terrible).  come on guys this used to be the best app ever what's going on?
13424,Student
13425,Where ever we need...‚ò∫‚ò∫
13426,Good  app but yes at the same time is little bit problematic
13427,After the update I can no longer view videos for any of my courses in the app-xperia z3
13428,Last update crashed the app. I can't get into any course...
13429,"I am not able find any options to download offline lectures using mobile data ....it just say waiting for connection, what is wrong with this app"
13430,Really awesome and helps a lot
13431,"This app presents the course as a pile of stuff. It doesn't remember where you are so as the course progresses doing anything is a tedious exercise in scrolling. No option to open links in external browser. If the phone locks or even rotates(!) while using the internal browser it resets you to the main page. For courses that are just a series of videos maybe it is adequate, but for anything else it is pretty useless."
13432,Loved it
13433,Amazing way to learn new skills
13434,My favorite education app
13435,"I can't find download video option anywhere, kindly guide me. Hate this new update"
13436,Oky
13437,Its not working over wifi
13438,Couldn't ask for more
13439,Logout then clear app data solved below  issue thanks ...When I login via web it is showing study content and lectures. Inspite of that course is already started it is showing nothing in app.
13440,Good app
13441,Good
13442,Provides the functionality needed to access the course material on the road
13443,Gud...
13444,Option to download videos to SD card is always resulting in app crash.  please fix that
13445,School
13446,Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini. App crashes when trying to select a course
13447,I have completed my online courses with this wonderful App. It's wonderful!
13448,This what education should be. For being accessible to all
13449,"Cherry on the cake,so easy to learn."
13450,Why doesn't it display that I have completed the quiz and sometimes it doesn't display quiz completed even when I have done so
13451,"This app is awesome, working satisfactorily but I am unable to save offline video in external memory."
13452,Good app however the speed of the lecture cannot be changed. Love to have that feature.
13453,App works fine but there's no control for video playback speed. Watching lectures faster is the highlight of coursera for me.
13454,Davuth
13455,I love it
13456,Awesome platform for learning
13457,The app lacks some functions which are available on website mode like changing the playback speed of lectures. Also there are sometimes problems on playing lectures of normal courses(other than on-demand courses)
13458,I have a paid Specialization course and another free course where neither are displaying any course content and many in the General Discussion board stating the same.  Also the camera will not focus in on Government ID for verification.  Please fix and I will fix the rating thanks
13459,I am able to write exams from the app but can't view the videos or slides and can't download them as well. Could you please fix this.. Thanks
13460,i cant send the photo for final verification.. plz check it ..
13461,Installed and managed to login but could not access course work after going into enrolled course. Ipad version works fine.
13462,Excellent  app
13463,Its good app. My phone has less internal storage. I would like the app to save offline videos directly to SD card.
13464,"One of the major advantages of having this app on the phone was that I could download videos while on Wifi and then go through them anywhere anytime. With the latest upgrade, I do not see the download option anymore. Please fix this."
13465,Love it
13466,Really helpful app love it
13467,Once logged in all I could see was the login screen. Attempts to login after that were met with a notice that you're already logged in
13468,I am happy to knew that there are somebody that think about our knowledge
13469,"If you like to study on the way to/from work, you should try it."
13470,Videos are sharp and clear. Great to catch up on a lesson right on your Smart Phone.
13471,This app gives all type of course.     This app also provides  course by computer
13472,Best app out there to further my learning
13473,"It's the greatest innovation that ever happened to curious minds, this app reaches out and educate people from all walks of life, for free. Coursera is moving in accordance with our basic technology needs"
13474,"Very rewarding, I can go at a slow pace"
13475,"Nice, organised and goot structured App."
13476,I can watch my videos on my smart phone or tablet. I don't have to be tied to a computer.
13477,Awesome!
13478,"Chromecast is finally back! :D  Few niggles to sort out but overall great app. However some of the lectures have a too low volume, I do watch while commuting in tube, and although I have noise cancel. headph. some lectures can be barely heard. I wish volume was consistent. Also I wish one could browse the course weekly view when offline, instead they can be accessed only via My downloads, in there they r all mixed in 1 big soup in there, so not very user friendly. Other than that, I love it."
13479,"Cannot login, invalid format for email address"
13480,Please add playback rate feature in future updates
13481,Cannot look at my the materials my current classes have. I want to be able to take the classes (3) but I cannot access the material. You cannot search for classes you already enrolled (I wanted to check if that is the way to go to the material for the course) got worse. I was able to access the material before.
13482,"Here's the thing; I saved a course to my watchlist. Its past session has finished like 2 years ago, and they're about to open a new session on October, so I was thinking about enrolling and saved it to my watchlist. Suddenly, when I installed and opened the app, it's as if I've took and completed the past session! All the video lectures were there. And so according to the app I also don't have any upcoming courses which is super weird because I do have it if I open the website. I'm definitely uninstalling."
13483,I love it ad more to app
13484,"Caller ID, photos, contacts, etc... All these info is not related to the course / service we use, please advise the reason of collecting the info before we use the app Thanks"
13485,Nice!
13486,"Se traba horrible la nueva versi√≥n y es m√°s complicado de usar, incluso visualmente es feo. L√°stima que hayan bajado la calidad de tan buena aplicaci√≥n, en lugar de hacerla mejor."
13487,Awesome
13488,ModPo class doesn't have forums and is a mess. It will be difficult for new students to follow through the disorganized files. I would drop this class but I have taken it before and loved it.
13489,Kept crashing. Uninstalled.
13490,"Please, add an important feature: save a course material, video and text files, to an external memory card. Your competitors have already done it.  Thanks!"
13491,Lots of very interesting topics.
13492,Very usefull
13493,"Wont even ooen and, what's worse,  clicking on 'find courses' at the coursera site in the browser throws me into the app store. Apparently I must use the app to use coursera, but the app doesn't work, constantly am told 'unfortunately,  coursera has stopped.' Well, unfortunately,  I'll be using edx for my next course.  Extremely frustrating. :("
13494,The app gives unfortunately stopped working error when I try to save content offline.
13495,Can be better
13496,It's just buffering and buffering and buffering ... Please fix it
13497,Thanks for the free education :)
13498,You're spearheading the future of education. Thank you.  Only 4 stars cause I can't communicate between phone and desktop...would also be cool to see a job board evolve.
13499,"Really bad, simply doesn't work. Won't update my progress. I have to use the browser."
13500,Keeps me from opening course 8n chrome
13501,Universal access to the world's best education.  This is the coursera mission. The app is great but limited functionality compared to the full website.
13502,I'd prefer using the browser to access Coursera if it didn't keep redirecting me to use this app... Using the browser was much faster
13503,Bugs in the app get in the way of learning. Customer service was responsive until they just stopped.
13504,Good
13505,There is lack in lot of features when compared to original site.
13506,For continuous redirection from a mobile website to this link without acess to mobile website.  It is ok to suggest an app but continously denying a user an access to website on mobile is criminal
13507,"Beware, Coursera will email you in the middle of the night and disprupt your sleep. Even after unsubscribing multiple times."
13508,How can I save relevant Video lectures in Offline mode
13509,Crashes :/
13510,I love coursera
13511,Intuitive and easy to navigate
13512,"I installed it on my cell phone. I have to try it on my laptop to see if it has the same efficiency, but all in all I thought it is a great app.  Great Job!!!"
13513,nice App
13514,This is a great app but I cannot download the lectures for offline use. Please fix it
13515,It's a comfort to be able to use this app on my phone.But unfortunately the screen starts getting hanged after a couple of uses till u reinstall the app.now that's a mess!
13516,"After this update, app starts periodically, not when needed, interrupts other activity, changes device orientation and what not. PLEASE DISABLE this! For now I made a new restricted device account just for Coursera, then uninstalled it from my primary, a simple PITA workaround :-/"
13517,The video stopped working so I cannot finish my assignments by due date.  Went online to finish and now if says it is over due
13518,The app is in line with the high quality of the site!
13519,Tried it
13520,I cannot play downloaded video lectures on my yu yureka after last update. Please fix. It was working before :(
13521,"I love this app, but I have one major problem with it. Every time I try to download notes on a course, it will not let me do it. I've tried it on three different devices and it still will not work. Also, I tried to contact y'all through the app and it wouldn't let me either."
13522,"Knowledge is borderless, awesome!"
13523,Working awesome again
13524,"It's been couple of years that I know Coursera and I'm so greatful of their service, I believe with Coursera world would be a better place. Keep Up the Good work"
13525,But videos stopped working
13526,"The moment it asked for contact, photo access and device info during an update, I click uninstall instead of update. This app should be used for studying and not to collect information about the user. I am already getting coursera ads on my email and I don't want them no where near my phone."
13527,Great app. Gives you access to world class education.
13528,I can't download the app although I ve registered for the program on the website. Help!!!!
13529,"Coursera's the best, trust me!"
13530,Loved it but the option of increasing the video speed would be much appreciated. Thanks!
13531,I'm enjoying the Mandarin course on both mobile and PC but find the reliance on having a webcam for verification a bit annoying.
13532,I can play videos but i cannot access quizes and other course materials
13533,Belajar menjadi demikian mudah dan menyenangkan. Gunakan waktu luang untuk menambah pengetahuan sehingga termanfaatkan dengan baik.
13534,I wish I'd found this before it is fast becoming my most used app as there are so many great courses. Highly recommended.
13535,"The app was great at first, for giving free lessons. But was disappointed when they turned the app into a business by giving paid lessons for at least 50 dollars. They should have but a donation account and be more voluntary for those who can't pay their lessons."
13536,"Hi! I'm new to Coursera and I'm wondering why I can't start. Today is the first day of "" Crafting an effective  writing"" but I can't view the videos and syllabus. Now I will try to download this app again to see if there's an improvement."
13537,"Felt my brain cells dying scrolling through Facebook.  Now, I'm learning topics that I've been curious about. Most interesting app I've downloaded yet."
13538,Hate this app
13539,Love it
13540,I'm a registered user but the mobile application won't load into my page
13541,"I keep getting notifications but when I acknowledge them the so crashes. Access to course information and forums difficult, I prefer the web interface."
13542,"It help me learning the new things on many fields in any time, any place, any device i have."
13543,Knowledge dissemination and empowerment laudatory work
13544,I just started a course last week and downloaded the app hoping it will be easier but since the last update videos dont load up on the app. They load up fine on the mobile browser so its definitely not the internet thats the problem. Hope the developers notice & fix this asap or else the whole point of having an app is wasted. Update: i reinstalled the app and it seems to be working fine now.
13545,Won't let me log in with Facebook or my email. Unusable.
13546,This app used to show course content and could stream to Chromecast. Now there is nothing but the course catalogue and descriptions. What's the point of this app now?
13547,The courses offered are awesome and very helpful.
13548,So handy
13549,It would helps us a lot. And most learners will be benefited at their finger tip
13550,Please add speed control feature to the app. It is really important for learners.
13551,Student
13552,Same problem as reported by others - course videos not playing.
13553,Successful negotiations: missing lot of courses....
13554,With your programming codes you are doing a dis-service to our beloved Coursera.
13555,It is very useful
13556,"I love Coursera and this used to be a great app, but now it doesn't show me videos for current courses and is inconsistent with the downloading of on demand videos. Also not all my previous courses are visible on the app...whereas they are on the site. The current course layout is confusing by mixing on demand and time-tabled courses...so it is now easy to miss dates, also...where is the option to sort courses by start date? Finally, really disappointed that the majority of On Demand courses do not offer statement of accomplishments. I will not pay for a certificate as I am only completing the courses for fun...but it was nice to have something I could keep to monitor my progress. Really disappointed with Coursera this year...having used it for two or three years now. I hope these problems are rectified soon."
13557,Great learning...
13558,Nice
13559,V good
13560,It's nice application
13561,Want to learn? Great. We'll use your info to send you spam!  Loads and loads of spam!
13562,Couldn't login. Unstalling after several attempts. It used to work but no more.
13563,"Coursera was the first MOOC I've  knew, and I am satisfied with this experiences. I always love to join the next courses in my field."
13564,constant pop ups forced me to install this app. Your UX guy sucks and should be fired
13565,Please check this bug As I can not watching videos I am only hearing . Do you have any suggestions for solving this issue from my side. Appreciating your feedback and fix ASAP.please when upload new version kindly write which bugs are fixed as until now video display are not working on some phons which you need testing your app in different version of android and mobile phone.waitting next upgrade to fix video problem.
13566,Please add video playback speed change support to the app!
13567,No course opens after the recent update. It worked very well before the update.
13568,More useful
13569,Great courses.
13570,The only reason I'm installing this stupid app is to stop the barrage of popups telling me to install the stupid app. I like learning so I give in: I'll download it. Here's a star.
13571,I cant seem to search on which courses are starting soonest anymore if they are not on demand.
13572,This is indeed a revolutionary way of learning!
13573,helpful for staying up to date with my courses
13574,Since a couple of versions the app keeps crashing when I try to download any of the courses. I'm trying to download them to SD. Issue still occurs as of 30.08.2015. (No fix for over two months)
13575,Like it
13576,"Minimal features, some quiz still requires browser, but it's still ok to learn on the go."
13577,Goosfraba...I can't get it to work.
13578,I have registered my self for digital marketing course and none of the video is playing. Plz help
13579,Best for studies
13580,Make me want to study again
13581,Knowledge is power y'all
13582,I wish there were more topics I could study even if they just taught us the basics it could have added a little more to the help you guys are providing... Keep up the good work guys
13583,"Now I can learn on the go! Just what I needed. Just one suggestion, could you incorporate a feature to speed up video playback?"
13584,I love this
13585,Cant download the app.
13586,The easy to use user interface and the registration process of Coursera is great.
13587,Hangs. every time I try downloading a file from the internet
13588,"Coursera still seems to be the best of the online learning apps available on Android.  But I'm concerned about the intrusive permissions requested with no explanation, so I am reluctant to use it. I'm glad that at least I can use Itunes U!"
13589,"Every time I click on one of my courses in the list it just crash and I have to restart.  The same in the last three updates including the new one on August 27, 2015 Galaxy Note 4"
13590,Every time I open the app it crashes after a few minutes. I never had this problem with earlier versions.
13591,The app would be great if it had a video quality control and a video speed control option.
13592,What's the point if almost all the videos aren't enabled to watch?
13593,Good job
13594,Coursera is the best mooc site ever
13595,"This  application is very useful. The online training is free, superb & interesting. Knowledge update is necessary."
13596,Abdul
13597,Great app
13598,Shuts down whenever I try to open a class
13599,You lost me right there!
13600,"The app is extremely slow, appearing to load tabs over a network connection. It is very buggy in regards to saving offline video. I'll be downloading the videos manually from now on."
13601,"Used app for 1+ yrs. Nothing good to say about it. Began with major login issues, passwords not saved nor updated immediately (at time of reset). Never fully resolved. Now, when you attempt a reset, the site claims your token has already expired - in less than 2 hours! When you are lucky enough to get it to work the lessons are downloaded and saved to the device, taking up significant amounts of space. There's got to be a better way. Til then, you're offa my phone."
13602,Does not work
13603,Won't update I don't want this to access my location
13604,Sehr gut
13605,5 stars if bug fixes are done . not able to send feedback there is an error saying NO RESPONSE FROM SERVER...
13606,The amount of perimissions needed are ridiculous. I simply won't install the app and keep working online untill it becomes an app purely for learning.
13607,Great app for learning and coursework!
13608,Make it Lightweight and add signature quiz support
13609,Thank you
13610,Mass
13611,Now the video won't play.  You shouldn't need my location either. Boo.
13612,You can get a certification of many university's around US at you home for a low price.
13613,This app has been updated with nice graphical interface.
13614,Great application for fast learning.
13615,"The application becomes less useful than before, which cannot view the videos of completed courses and it is hard to find the downloaded videos when it is offline. The old app does them well.  The website now works better, more powerful and useful than this new app and it makes the app even more useless.   For all ongoing courses the app works fine and it deserves a higher rating score, and keeping providing most of the courses for free makes Coursera a very good reputation. But still, only with respect to its current app, it is hard to give a high rating score."
13616,Love it
13617,Best education app
13618,Thank you for everything you doing!
13619,Still no speeding up of videos
13620,Really worth trying
13621,"Nice app -- but I have to mark it ""Just OK"" until you can adjust the video speed. This is a crucial feature for learning lectures."
13622,"Seriously, why do you need location permission for me to watch coursera videos? This is sketchy practice, at best, and downright wrong at worst."
13623,Nice
13624,Latest update demanded access to location.  Previous version worked fine without it.  Uninstalled.
13625,I like it
13626,"The app worked fine for like 1.5 months (mid of July to today, 21/08/15). But then it starts to close itself everytime I try to access a page that contains non-video content. Video pages work fine."
13627,Thank you :)
13628,Awesome way to keep learning.
13629,"I downloaded videos to watch on the train, but if I launch while out of reception I can't do ANYTHING until back in reception, most of my trip wasted. So unnecessary."
13630,Is not possible to keep listening while the display is off!
13631,"Needs multi window support for Galaxy Note devices for side by side note taking when watching videos. Also Signature Track verification and payments need to be brought to mobile. Saving offline to SD card was a massive step forward, keep building on it. UPDATE: In version 1.6.4 the app maintained the older, more consistent, more tablet friendly UI. However the current version 1.6.8 build once again reverts to a phone/small screen UI:  -No slide out menu -Menu is hidden behind the icon at the top left which is unintuitive  -The menu is PORTRAIT ONLY (Poor usability on a tablet)  It is obvious this is an attempt at refining the app and introducing more material design elements, however it appears not ready for tablets. Please make previous build 1.6.4.1 available for download as a fall back for people like me with an 8 inch tablet(Galaxy Note 8 N5100) as the current layout is regression in usability for me"
13632,Says network error. All other apps on my phone work. Love coursera BTW...
13633,Loved it gives me lessons to learn
13634,"I really love coursera service and to have it on my phone and take it anywhere with me is just great opportunity never leave my study, so thanks for this app!"
13635,The videos won't play - it just spins and spins. I then got the latest update and same issue.
13636,It suggests the developer was lazy or incompetent when an app requires access to the entire phone for an app that merely displays information and interacts with the user and a single website.
13637,The best way to learn !
13638,Good app. User interface is horrible. Videos are not well optimised to mobile resolution.
13639,This is how it should be taught in Indian colleges.
13640,But some courses don't seem to support offline viewing. Pls correct.
13641,Thanks good job but I think you can do more  on software
13642,Theee best! Just the best
13643,"Suggestion: offer entomology courses, beyond what one can learn from public tv/documentaries. (No online suggestion box found). Free education! Exactly what I was looking for - like auditing courses except can do this anytime"
13644,Hi!! Coursera is real boon for a learner like me who does not have much opportunities. Learning is very easy as so many world class instructors and mentors designed the courseware. These courses are really awesome and GREAT!! It supports now slow internet by giving option of OFFLINE READING. Love you
13645,"Am satisfied with concept and presentation of this app. The only issue is contents aren't loading. Since the recent update of the app, videos aren't loading."
13646,Its very useful
13647,"Previous versions handled offline playback much better,  this one still wants to connect to the Internet and hangs up when it can't. Dev  team please fix this issue. Thank you"
13648,Good.
13649,It's a very good and fantastic app
13650,Are all courses free?
13651,Xxdxxxxxxxdddd
13652,This app is asking for to many permission.  Why would it need my browser history or my camera?  Plus access to check out my wifi network.  This is spyware at it's best.
13653,Thanks. This version is much better that the previous one.
13654,Great stuff
13655,Amazing for people who are busy and can't make it to a class roommate
13656,Excel tool for whose is seeking a higher education!
13657,For learning at all levels
13658,This was a fantastic app until the latest update. Practically unusable for me now. Doesn't even load any content anymore.
13659,Good but can't get it on Lumia 520
13660,Awesome app
13661,I absolutely love the site and the app. The only thing I would add would to be able to bookmark a course that I am interested in to take at a later date. With my schedule I can only take one course at a time and always have a hard time finding the courses I was interested in later.
13662,"""Coursera has stopped"" is an everyday message"
13663,I was trying to review the list of available courses and was forced to install this app to look at a course description.  Became stuck in a password reset loop.  After having to reenter my email about a dozen times I gave up. Apparently just a HTML app anyway - if my interest returns I follow-up on my PC.
13664,App crashed while sending feedback. Uninstalling to use web browser instead if you let me. (Please stop with the fast redirection crap. If I want the app I'll use it)
13665,Best app to learn
13666,The app keeps crashing and unable to play videos. I fail to see why isnt the Coursera team working on fixing the app.
13667,Pretty well organized and put together. It is so great to have access to such a useful content. This app has added a lot of value un my life.
13668,"Conceptual brillant way to learn, expand or brush up on a wide variety of knowledge."
13669,It's a good app
13670,It's a cool app.
13671,"Coursera is an awesome initiative providing us with quality online education. I am a self taught Game programmer I've worked on both large and small scale projects. And currently working with africa's leading mobile game developer, leti arts. I have no degree .. all self taught."
13672,"Nice app.  Pretty well organized and put together.  I really lik eteh Coursera classes.  There are only three things that I feel need improvement with the app. First and most important is that you NEED the ability to setup and verify your account for quizzes via a mobile device. The app already requests camera access and the typing pattern (while different from a PC) is still unique on a mobile device so there is no reason you should need to use a PC and webcam for verification. It is really restrictive not being able to use the mobile app for verified content. On a similar thread, I had some trouble with images in quizzes.  They are very small and the app does not allow for rotation. There is an enlarge image button, but that didn't work all the time and wasn't always enough when it did work. Please add rotation and free zoom for graphics. Finally, the Save For Offline needs to have a cellular/WiFi selection option for downloading content. It seems to download on WiFi only, but only some of the time. Some user settings might make things smoother. Pretty fair app overall and great courses."
13673,"Upon account creation  the app gives access to a great variety of courses in a wide diversity of fields, at various entry levels. It would have been great to have additional functions like a watch list, and ability to organize courses in the catalog by date added (without having to flip through the whole thing every time)"
13674,"Can't browse a course without installing this app, and then I still couldn't browse a course. Fail."
13675,"If you guys can give option to complete & submit assignments through the app it would be just icing on cake. Please devs, much needed thing."
13676,This was a 5-star-app until last update on android 5.1 came on.Since then I am not able to watch any of the downloaded courses.Please fix this issue.Thanks.
13677,Thank you
13678,heard frm my teacher... nd its awesome
13679,Keep up the good work you are awesome!!!!
13680,"Updated review - after reinstall app now works, so great!"
13681,The app crashes in the loading screen. Please fix it. I use an lg g2 phone with lollipop 5.1.1
13682,"I had trouble learning Calculus, but now I think I'm gonna make it!"
13683,"Content is absolutely amazing, the changed interface is great as well. But what's the point if the videos don't load."
13684,All things are going well...  But suddenly the msg comes tht...  Unfortunately coursera stopped and I can't able to open it. Plz solve the issue
13685,It gives me everything that I want in one place
13686,Norton Mobile Security now flags this app as HIGH RISK. The permissions are far too intrusive for an app like this. Beware!
13687,"hi guys,  First thank you for the app, it is so great to offer access to this kind of content. My only issue is the following: User's favorite course:  When browsing courses, I'm often interested by several courses at the same time, but sadly, without joining the course i don't have any way to pin (to keep) those courses in my profile to review them later and choose whatever course is really interesting me.  If you add the ""Favorited courses"" option You can also add reminders of these courses that for users 2 or 3 days before it starts.  that's all, good luck"
13688,"Requires access to almost anything on the phone - calls, accounts, contacts, files etc. And at the end no videos can be played. Removed."
13689,Its nice
13690,"Absolutely awesome, thrilled by the audacity to deliver such knowledge to discerning students, at the click of a button."
13691,An amazing resource
13692,"Mobile app is a must have for Coursera, so it's a real shame they went only half way. It's missing variable video speeds, quizes, and most importantly - in-video questions. This makes it unusable for question-heavy lectures."
13693,Simply..bst
13694,This app has added a lot of value in my life.  The content is Amazing!!! State of the art. World Class!
13695,I just love the Coursera concept !! The app is very convenient too
13696,Curanderismo traditional medicine
13697,I have so much to learn. I love it. It did really a big help.
13698,Fantastic
13699,It helps a lot using the app rather than every time opening the computer.
13700,Do you provide a certificate in the end of a course?
13701,I'd rather use the webpage than the app on my phone.
13702,Great App
13703,Awesomely edducative....
13704,This is a very nice and informative site but its Videos are coming out all blank Its only streaming the audio  Please fix this problem
13705,Will rate you 10 given a chance to download the stuff for offline viewing. Thank you :)
13706,One of few educational must have app
13707,Just great!
13708,Better app for exploring and innovative thinking students
13709,I am forced to install the app to use the website and after that it doesn't even work?! What the heck is this?! I can't login in the app (although I log in through the website) and can't start the intro videos even
13710,I can only hear the audio. A black spot coming instead of Video. Disappointed.
13711,Just an amazing thought that changes ordinary minds to extraordinary minds. Hats off
13712,"Great app ,fun learning"
13713,"A bit laggy for me, but it's content is worth it."
13714,Need to improve a lot. No option to make a wish list of courses we like. Hopeful...
13715,Marketing specialist
13716,I now cannot even download material to watch offline on my tablet!
13717,Can't play the video! Don't make sense to me. :'(
13718,Ultimate learning experience
13719,liked the android version but still needs improvement
13720,Data Science Statistical Metods Marketing  are interesting courses
13721,Please allow playback rate as we have in the web version
13722,Perfect
13723,amazing
13724,Works great again.  Thank you Coursera! I finished The Paradoxes of War and am now going to start a new course.  Wonderful app.  I feel blessed to live in an age where we have an app like this
13725,"app uses in-phone starage instead of sd-card (as all the applications do it), so i cannot download lot of lectures, install new applications and my phone constantly yells ""phone storage is low  there was nice applications from third-party developers for coursera, in which i was able to cache lectures for few full courses - but looks like coursera wants to be a monopolist. so now in my vacation i have to jump from cafe to cafe catching wifi and downloading one by one lectures and erase as i saw them"
13726,Limited features. Needs  lot of improvements.
13727,Great app for learning
13728,The app won't even install. Courses are also forcing the use of the app when on a mobile device. The site should give the option of using a browser when on a mobile device.
13729,"I love the content of this app, but every time I close the app after watching lecture videos I have to uninstall and reinstall it to continue viewing my course. I'll select a lecture to view and it shows a loading screen but the video never plays."
13730,"Personally I'm in love with the services provided by coursera but the android app isn't at all satisfactory. Takes a few seconds to load properly in my device. Needs huge improvement, guys."
13731,Please add function watching video from courses list without internet access.  I know it's possible watch it by list with downloaded files but is enough clear and easy to choose what user want.
13732,Best place to learn!
13733,Good way
13734,This is a blessing. Free education it's a gift and I am very thankful.:-)) :-))
13735,Crashes very often.
13736,Courses available are useful and awesome.
13737,I cannot find button for downloading videos for offline viewing
13738,"Please how do I find my courses, I HAVE installed the app but i don't  have same experience like in the web... can someone help please"
13739,"The app offers only a fraction of the functionality of the website. But the website dumps you into the app at every turn, locking you out of functionality and information. Designed by monkeys whose target audience was probably morons."
13740,Awesome
13741,Simply Awesome
13742,No words... Awesome app
13743,Thank u for this big work (y)
13744,"First of all thanks to coursera for providing free online courses. Its a great thing. However i have a problem with this app. I am able to either join or unjoin the course. However after joining a course, I am not able to goto classes. Also downloaded videos gets erased automatically. The app gives no information about the courses that I have joined or registered."
13745,"Much needed for course attendees. But unthoughtful UI, limited features, inconsistent behavior across different courses and bugs make it frustrating to use!!!"
13746,High level courses in several professional areas.
13747,Ah! The additional links do respond. That's great.
13748,Thnks coursera
13749,Gr8
13750,Everyone have to use this app
13751,Why force me to install the app. I just want to sign up from my phone
13752,"This is an excellent way to study, depend on your will because the videos and all of that things are so fine."
13753,It's a great app but it keeps crashing any time I switch to a different app
13754,Great for self learners
13755,App keeps crashing when trying to save topic for offline reading...please fix it
13756,The circle is turning and turning and turning
13757,Thanks
13758,Liked it
13759,"This. App is less than useless for me. I can't get to the demo site from here. I can't even use the browser version on my tablet because it redirects me to the app. And why does the app require access to my contacts? Lame, and a waste of my time and bandwidth :("
13760,"This app is very useful,thank you"
13761,
13762,Learn wat ever you loved to !
13763,What an iFail. What is this 2007? - even the Applecrats at Chipotle have a functioning Android app these days. I guess you can use the iOS version on your Grandma's iPad for signature courses.
13764,"Free learning, how could you complain?"
13765,Its awesome
13766,Cool
13767,I have tried to use coursera android app on my huawei g700 over the last 4 months and it has always crashed. I have tried it on other android phone and the same problem. I wished you could get professional developers to do this job.
13768,Amazing
13769,Best MOOC App I came across!!!
13770,Lot of p.langs can learn from here.
13771,The UI update made the app even better!
13772,The best free lessons from great universities. Simply awesome
13773,"After last update, application became very slow. Not able to open any videos!.."
13774,"So something about, it is a good app"
13775,Love it
13776,After the last update I'm not able to save for offline viewing the videos that i want. Before i just selected the ones that i want it to download now even the ones that i already watched have to be downloaded i don't like that. Please fix that.
13777,I must say this app and Coursera has improved my quality of living
13778,Very good
13779,Use it its good
13780,"Excellent application, access to amazing resources and without charge."
13781,
13782,Nice to have you guys on Android platform
13783,"What is the use of offline view , if not a single video can be downloaded."
13784,Lumea
13785,Amazing resources
13786,√áok faydalƒ±
13787,Free and open high level education will broaden the human future as a species.
13788,Excellent app!
13789,I like this app
13790,Very good
13791,Love it
13792,Doesn't show the capstone course in the list of current courses. Overall poor user experience.
13793,Love the learn at your own pace feel & love the fact real life professors from actual acredidted Universities are taught through this site
13794,Very useful
13795,Very Useful!
13796,"Old app let you watch archived courses,  has simple intuitive interface. And now it's a f**king disaster,  useless tiles, no archived courses, come on guys!! Yesterday was watching archived course, today in updated app I can't, never was so disstressed üòû by app update in my life"
13797,For people who aspire to learn anything without a cost this is our chance.. And for god sake the people who said the app is bad because the video etc is not that good. IT'S FOR FREE! Be thankful.
13798,Love it
13799,Learning
13800,I took course on laptop but in between continued it on app. The app asked to retake all the quiz that I have already cleared.
13801,Good
13802,It's excellent...!!!!
13803,"I love coursera and the courses, but the app needs a lot of work. It does not allow you to access all the information you can on the website for each course. Also, it crashes constantly when I try and search for courses."
13804,Its fantastic but facing issues at question ..unable to see images only text appears
13805,Excellent App!
13806,"Unlike Udacity and EdX, Coursera won't let me sign in with my existing Google account on my device."
13807,Great!
13808,Good for DIY students
13809,ŸÖÿ±ÿ≥€å
13810,It will be useful if you add the inline-video quizzes and the ability to speed up the videos while using the app.
13811,This has always been the best.
13812,I KNOW my email Addy and password ARE CORRECT! Don't understand why I cannot log in.
13813,Download course vids to watch offline is pretty much the only reason to use it.
13814,I like to studying coursera for my mobile SAMSUNG
13815,but I cant go to some Coursera pages without the ad for this thing popping up.
13816,Superb
13817,"It's good to watch the video, but it's not possible to perform the tests that appear on the videos."
13818,"I love Coursera, but the app is really bad. The video blocks every time: even if i can hear the audio, the video is stuck for 3-4 seconds, then it is sync for some seconds again, and then again stuck. The quiz in-video lectures aren't shown also."
13819,I cant login my account though it is connected to my Facebook account.  Please fix.
13820,Interesting it is
13821,Awesome
13822,it's simply ow...!!!?
13823,I love the new version. Thanks guys!
13824,Hard to believe anyone still thinks it's a good idea to use logins that require giving up your credentials to third-party accounts.
13825,good interface.new course to explore.
13826,Great
13827,Awesome tool
13828,"It's a great web-site and great application! I highly recommend it. With every update a lot of new features are coming. Thanks for doing that! However, it would be nice to have assess to archieved courses, which are available through the website but not in this app (e.g. Data analysis and statistical inference). I believe this small feature will make this app even better :)"
13829,"The videos are the only content  in the app, and they aren't  working. Just a black screen."
13830,Good and free to learn everything what you want
13831,"The app gives me access to the videos for the course I'm in but that's pretty much it. I can't get into the assignments or the discussion forums. To actually do the course work I need to go back to the web browser, so the app is of limited value. At least by installing the app I am no longer promped to install it every time I go to the website."
13832,This the future of education
13833,Pretty good for me
13834,For learning
13835,This email format is invalid even though I'm signed up for courses and they are emailing me..
13836,I loved it
13837,I miss  the translation because it doesn't appear any more ...... Please make it back.
13838,For the lectures I am getting only audio and a black screen !! Please help ASAP
13839,Cool learn from top universities at home
13840,Truly fantastic app Universities of the world in hand
13841,"It was Ok in previous course, but now I can't play video in R Programming course. I'm using HTC M8 Android 5.0.1. It shows can't play video error."
13842,Great how it downloads the seminars for future read without streaming. You tube came up with his idea recently in India but you guys were much ahead with f them
13843,Way to many permissions requested to provide course work.
13844,Its nice to see my study on phone
13845,Really helpful
13846,I installed it before but now i have problems to install it.
13847,Here you can get all the information you want to !
13848,"It used to be a very fine app, very useful, very handy. With a couple of bugs. Now, losing so many previously existing features, it feels weird. Hopefully a white board in progress?"
13849,"Talk about spam mail after Uninstalling this! Nothing i wanted now, but would i like to waste my time and MONEY on their suggested courses? NO!"
13850,Vbnm nice
13851,Nice application for learning various types of courses.
13852,Very nice and useful app
13853,The best app. Forever.
13854,It been real go for me so far....grades recorded and learning new stuff
13855,Thank you for this website.  I learnt many things .
13856,please get more  courses....deserves a 5 star
13857,It doesn't work
13858,Why I can't turn on the subtitle??
13859,Would like an app option for keeping track of when classes become available.
13860,Signed up for a course.  Started watching videos for it and taking quizzes for it.  Thought I was doing everything but turns out I missed a bunch of testing assignments and a project worth 25% of your grade.  The app had nothing at all about these.
13861,thank you.
13862,Very great for learning. But you may cost too much data for video loading.
13863,I love their education.......
13864,Good app and would like few more features: (1) like to move the downloaded videos to the additional SD card storage and (2) Save and view the downloaded videos to computer. I am unable to view the videos via file explorer. (3) option to turn on the sub titles when viewing the lectures
13865,Free education
13866,Frustrating....... cannot access what I want to do
13867,The videos are big files and a txt file with the transcript would be great!
13868,"Coursera the website is great, the Android app, not so much.  Seems like they put in the minimal effort to be able to say they have an Android app and left it at that.  Need to be able to control playback speed like on the web, the teachers speak way too slowly."
13869,You need to make running the videos with the screen switched off an option. Being forced to have it on drains too much battery and data to be useful.
13870,"not able to login from FB , using FB LITE app"
13871,nice
13872,Great app for continous learning
13873,Bravooo
13874,The app has good features but takes a lot of time for processing.
13875,Good one
13876,A chance to refresh my knowledge
13877,It's a useful app for fulfill curiosity itself.
13878,I simply love this app
13879,"The menu that contains links to ""My courses"", ""my downloaded videos"" etc,  appears sometimes, and it does not at other times. Also, the ""my downloaded videos"" list cannot be grouped by courses."
13880,I love this. thank you all.
13881,I attempted a quiz twice and non of them were recorded and now I won't even get my credits! It was a waste of my time
13882,The new version is poorly optimized for Android 4.1. I cant even search!!!
13883,Head of section
13884,Coursera really is key to knowledge
13885,Please add video
13886,Fantastic app
13887,GOOD
13888,The interface could be made more user friendly!
13889,Should support lower versions of Android too!!
13890,Essential to my growth
13891,"Why would this app need the permission to start at boot time, read my contacts, draw over other apps or even access the camera?"
13892,Love to use it....
13893,App doesn't complete the loading process. It won't download to my Note 4.
13894,Or just download video and caption file with reasonable file name so I can play it using some other software like VLC that support playback speed control.
13895,Every thing is great but the speed of loading contents
13896,"Lack of playback speed control is the biggest problem with this app, at least for me. In addition, not all in-video quizzes are shown in the app, most of the time they are just missing from the videos when watched in the app. Please fix these issues and I'll give you 5 stars."
13897,I loved being able to learn new things in an easy way
13898,Good
13899,Outstanding
13900,"Only lists course lectures and videos, no discussions, no peer reviews, no facility for copy and paste from other documents, nowhere to complain! Coursera's good reputation harmed by this inadequate app."
13901,Not able to download the app.
13902,Baik
13903,Well informed instructors well supported information and case studies.
13904,"After new update, voice is not transmitted to my car bluetooth"
13905,COOOL
13906,I used to download videos overnight on my cellphone internet. But in the new version video download is allowed only using wifi! Fix this! I loved the old version!
13907,Thank you coursera
13908,Enrolled in the Project Management course. Videos won't play. Just keeps buffering without playback. On mobile data and wifi. Note 4 running on lollipop.
13909,"Since the last update, I still can't un-enroll from a course plus I have to log in every single time I launch the app, please fix"
13910,New update lot of bugs. Video lectures won't download for offline use. Pls fix
13911,Good app
13912,Its gooood
13913,Great app for keep learning
13914,None of the links to materials on other sites would open.
13915,It kept crashing after 2 days of installation.
13916,Love it
13917,"I've really enjoyed hammering through a course with this app, but it bugs me to have to log in with my email - why isn't there a log in with Google option?"
13918,It's best edn apps
13919,"This is a great app and platform, but sadly the subtitles don't show up in Chromecast, I'll give you five stars when you fix this issue."
13920,What
13921,"In play store apps says that its free courses,  no just lies for you to get app then ask for money. Would have taken courses,  but you have lied to me, me dont  trust you now or Ever!"
13922,I love course era but not this app
13923,This app crashes when I click save for offline.
13924,"Videos of the courses are good, we can download and watch offline.  But forum and discussion, comments parts need to be included in the app version."
13925,Wonderful app
13926,"I can't take tests on android, that really bugs me because my computer broke and now I have no way to take tests üò≠"
13927,"It works perfectly fine for me. Love it actually, I've been looking for an app like this"
13928,Training
13929,Mobile App - Not so good.
13930,The course is already available on website but still not on the app. Kindly improve this. Thanks!
13931,Categorized as sports app on everythingme
13932,"Lacks critical features for playing lectures. Coursera itself deserves five starts, but the Android app lacks many key features. I never listen to anything at less than 1.5 playback speed, so I really can't use this app. Additionally, I often want to keep listening to a lecture as audio only when I turn the screen off. Currently, I find it more worthwhile to download the videos and watch them on a decent video player. This is a hassle, but far less frustrating than using the useless player of this app."
13933,Nice
13934,I can barely hear your learning about learning course at phone and external speaker max. This is the fourth time I've attempted to contact you about this. Every time your app quits.  Please respond.
13935,"Used to be simple and reliable, but now keeps crashing, getting slower every update, and doesn't work offline, even when you have downloaded videos beforehand... Please fix it!"
13936,Just love it!
13937,Best app ever
13938,"I give it an extra star just because it can view, save the lectures and conducts quizzes.  Every other feature found on the website is missing here (resource links, notes, forum support, auto graded assignments, etc)"
13939,Fantastic app
13940,Please enable downloading of txt and pdf files.
13941,Couldn't reset forgotten password from phone. Tried to get a new password. You sent me a request to reset password but when I entered it said request token invalid. Did this two or three times same result. Get your act together
13942,Great app to learn new things and review
13943,"New design of ""my courses"" page is not so good - loss of wasted space."
13944,"Now that lectures can be downloaded to SD storage, the app is great!"
13945,Learn anything on the go
13946,This is one of the best way to share knowledge.  Coursera is doing the best for whole world
13947,"It works perfectly well for me, the offline content is a great idea to learn on the go. Happy learning :)"
13948,"It keeps throwing up a loop. The phone has become unusable. Have had to uninstall it. There is dialog box ""Unfortunately Coursera has stopped.""  and it keeps popping up. I am not even using Coursera and it happens randomly. EDIT: Seems to have fixed the crash loop."
13949,"I don't give 1 star because I DO LOVE coursera, but I cannot give you guys full credit if I cannot enter the app to study... It crashes everytime I try. I've reseted my phone several times now, cleaned the cache... Please, try to fix it as I may not be able to meet some deadlines :( // Update: THANKS for the update and reply!! You are the best!"
13950,Developers please go through it. I have a course that starts in a couple of days.
13951,Cule. I helps me learn what I want to learn in college. Yeay
13952,"On Galaxy S4, android 5. Works smoothly and is stable. Earlier version bugs when rendering maths symbols and layout of equations now seem to be fixed. Functions missing from app: download course for offline viewing, no comments section below videos as present in windows version."
13953,Once the app is better I will rate 5 stars because Coursera is awesome
13954,Nice
13955,Slides and audio don't match sometimes. This happens every time you go back to review a part of the lecture video. Also cannot find reference documents related to lecture on the app.
13956,I love it...!!
13957,:)
13958,please fix the crashes
13959,"app is ok but after the latest update, it keeps crashing and cannot access the mobile app already.. hopefully this can be fixed."
13960,I prefer read and watch the content in more dark colors schemes than white background in mobile devices. Some of this configuration would be awesome!
13961,Learning on the go best app
13962,Fails to install
13963,This has become extremely extremely buggy. Used to be rock solid.
13964,"Subtle bug, previous video's subtitle keeps running even after the video changes."
13965,It says coarsera has stopped working
13966,"Great to see official Coursera app, at last. But unfortunately offline mode doesn't work. Pressed ""Save for offline"" and after some while a notification with text ""Your lectures are now available offline"" or something like that appeared. But when offline I can't open the course (says that I need a connection) and also no videos available under Downloads - You haven't downloaded any videos."
13967,Vedio playing problem on nexus 4
13968,Cant download / view readings. Also give course start & end date in the course info
13969,I am using this app almost a year. But can't done a course. Cause i always forgot. Please. Improve it. It helps me to understand more. Thank youu.
13970,"I think app doesn't show forums, or I missed it."
13971,"Smooth, sleek, easy to use. No glitches yet. Best feature: one tap download for lectures of an entire week."
13972,"The on demand courses design is so slow loading and the math quizzes always tell me: ""Math processing error"". Please fix. I need to finish my calculus one course. Unless you fix. 3 stars."
13973,FREE programming courses to management.
13974,It is great to use the app because you can watch your videos offline. But I have a problem on mgmt HTC desire 816 lollipop when I set storage to sd card and try to save on demand videos I get an exception.
13975,"Studing the Stanford ML course , sound is not playing!"
13976,Coursera rocks!!
13977,Whats the use u are demanding the access to the device images videos and audios although also from external storage . contacts and everything pls explain reason.?
13978,Would u like to learn or teach? Download it and then joint the courses u want.
13979,"Make possible to change video speed like in web version, please."
13980,i want this to be a constant part of my daily life. learning has never been so accessible! and the wide-array of topics -- unbelievable!
13981,MOOCs. Is the future of learning.
13982,It's so handy using coursera on a smartphone. I can watch the video courses anytime I like without having to have my laptop wherever I go.
13983,Awesome
13984,Great tool to elevate your intellectual skills
13985,I have only tried one course but it was really good and there are so many to browse
13986,It is near perfect
13987,"This app is user friendly, the bug causing it to close often was fixed. It's using less Data so I'm happy so far!"
13988,No Discussion Forum Tab for Any Course
13989,"I paid for signature track and they were saying I can retake the course. I paid even though I didn't have time to finish the course for that month.  Later on they changed their fine print and asked for repay in the next month.  Highly discourage paying for the courses.  Use it for free, Just avoid the signature track or any payment"
13990,Useful
13991,Works perfectly. No problems encountered so far. Very smooth and easy to use.
13992,Won't let me login. What's the point of the app then? I love the desktop courses though.
13993,Blessing!!
13994,Thanks so much for making this app and offering the service!
13995,Excellent!
13996,Very good application and contents
13997,But needs to provide the discussion forum
13998,Excellent
13999,nc app
14000,Coursera - truly transformational!
14001,Nice app to learn something always new
14002,I cannot see the videos
14003,Amazing courses
14004,Just loved it.
14005,HamiedRza go
14006,But daily notification should be added....!!!üòê
14007,Great app
14008,App is useless to me without Chromecast
14009,Good
14010,The best app to learn variety of new things in an very convenient way. It also makes videos for offline viewing........
14011,Pl add daily notifications.
14012,But can you add a notification so i wont forget to do this everyday?
14013,"Although I really like the normal website and wanted to install the app, it's asking for far too many permissions. Why are all  those blanket permissions required rather than what the app really needs to work properly?"
14014,I can study at online with this app.
14015,Search and browse functions are broken.
14016,As a android Developer please support to play video on other installed player!
14017,Cool app
14018,"Without downloading lectures, they simply jump from one file to the next without actually playing any audio. Once downloaded, they continue to play, pause button will not work, and it will not stop playing, even after closing the app? - Large selection of courses though, new classes being added regularly."
14019,Loved this app that's really fffffffffantastic
14020,A tablet layout would be really nice for this kind of application.
14021,Nice
14022,Thank you very much
14023,"Love this it really helps me stay up to date w/ all of my classes/courses!!  Try, for making this app available!"
14024,This app is developed for phones only. please develop tablet version of this app.
14025,I really like the concept of open learning that platforms like coursera have brought into picture. The app as such is okay and could use more features where we could tweak the settings. Especially controlling the playback speed.
14026,"Poor app, I decided to uninstall. There's no point in having it in my phone when I cannot use it with the same privilege as in the website."
14027,Love  Love   Love
14028,A GREAT opportunity for those who want to brush up on their skills in maybe a new field or even with something they are currently interested in but are limited in funding.
14029,Love the app and the service
14030,Great program
14031,What more do you want in life?
14032,Awesome.       10out of 10
14033,Invest in Education
14034,Loved it
14035,I have used coursera for sometime now and I have achieved so many of my goals in life. I am pursuing a master's degree and I have found the knowledge I acquired through Coursera lessons a help of infinite wealth to my career purpose. Thanks Coursera Team.
14036,I like that learning app.
14037,Perfect to cathch a few lectures on the go
14038,Best app to learn any thing &lt;3
14039,Awesome
14040,"Since last update, able to only watch videos that I can download. Since all videos are not downloadable then missing parts of my courses.FIX IT"
14041,Courses that I enrolled in via the app are not appearing in the list of enrolled courses when i log in into my id from any browser.
14042,Keeps crashing and offline downloads not working properly
14043,"The pictures that are used in the quiz are at times not visible(full screen and otherwise). Its not the internet connection because, I did try it on more than 4 WiFi spots and mobile data. The pictures do show up sometimes but that's a rare case. If possible please let me know if its not a bug and is an error with my phone."
14044,This app is very very good
14045,Tough to verify its me.
14046,Really really Amazing app.I can learn anything I want.
14047,"My computer was not playing the course videos,  this app will. Saved my course!!!"
14048,I love Coursera apps
14049,Good
14050,I like it
14051,Very good. Thank you so much.
14052,like
14053,"While I absolutely adore Coursera, this app is still immature. Lecture download and playback is solid, but the rest of the functionality is lacking. Content downloads and hyperlinks, while shown, aren't functional. Also, I have just experienced a massive fail where I finished a problem set, and when I submitted my work, it suddenly told me I wasn't logged in, and lost all my inputs, effectively wasting me half an hour. I hope there is still work being done on this app, as I'd love to use it more."
14054,Love it
14055,"Am veronica Stephen,am a secondary school teacher in Nigeria. Am taking this course for professional development.also to acquire new skills as a teacher."
14056,Awesome
14057,Can learn anything...... More than a university......
14058,So important App for such important platform
14059,I like this
14060,It is very useful for the youth so I will give 5 star
14061,Learning anything I want for free without pre-requested class knowledge. I feel a sence of freedom I've never felt before. TY Coursera
14062,Always do the best to help promote education... And health issues...
14063,Knowledge knowledge knowledge
14064,My app doesn't open anymore... bad. Why guys?  Why?  Please fix it.
14065,Very good app indeed..learning at any tym  n any where..
14066,"Nice app...easy way studying, being offered by best universities of the world at your fingertips..."
14067,Very disappointing that they would remove Chromecast without any warning!
14068,"I can't take my picture from Android, telling me ios. Why get the Android version then? Important things for certificate track, then it sucks"
14069,Dope!
14070,I did a computer science major equivalent from coursera courses. The unbeleivable part is that it's all for free!
14071,Nothing better to do...on vacation
14072,Wonderful app and the recently  added offline download  feature is awesome!
14073,Nice tool to help brush up in the summertime.
14074,Amazing. Free courses. Also great job to the schools for providing and allowing these classes.
14075,good
14076,Great classes offered by top colleges and universities and they are all free!
14077,"This app is awesome, but when I try to watch on Chromecast the subtitles don't work. Only me have this problem? Any solution??"
14078,"I'm enrolled in a few different courses and I absolutely love them. Definitely works with my work schedule as well. I go to work during the night then come home in the morning, watch a couple of lesson videos, do my work, then I go to bed. Definitely recommending to my friends."
14079,This app gives so much in a little pack...there might be few bugs...but one of the best apps to learn on the go....thank you coursera team for this lovely app
14080,"Do it for you, not credit.  Top schools, great subjects, and it's free!  Why are people complaining about not getting credit?  If you want to learn, can't beat it."
14081,Its very useful tool.it enables me to follow my courses in essy way.
14082,"It's a godo tool for my, It's really interesting"
14083,loved it
14084,"Lovin' it, the app help to explore wide range of fields that can stuff our brain with knowledge."
14085,"This app has some decent courses on it, but it's not a very large selection. The app itself was nice but upon simply looking at the courses (not even signing up) my inbox is now filling with emails. All I did was watch the introduction videos and I'm getting course announcements without even signing up for them."
14086,Perfect
14087,"I tried this app when it was still new and had some problems with loading videos, now it works seamlessly."
14088,Love this app
14089,Courses provided are very good. Faced 2 issues. Not able to download videos to phone.  And a video once seen doesn't reload again. Minor bugs when compared to the big picture... Kudos to the app
14090,Superb
14091,Love it! To the people that say that its a waste of time because you don't get credits for the course: if you put a verified accomplishment certificate (obtainable via $29 charge) in your r√©sum√© I don't think its wasted because employers will look at it! Plus taking free courses is always an enrichment for your own education... I'm very grateful for this!
14092,easy learning through your screen
14093,This is one of the best. Free and easy..  some cost a little for the completed certificates but there are options for people to get them at no cost. Just a little of your spare time or all can open up a wide variety of learning.. for free!
14094,I was looking for this app to complete my courses!! Awesome
14095,Learn a lot. Easy to use.
14096,Overall app performs OK. But not having ability to play videos at higher speed is a big problem.
14097,"Seriously, such a basic feature so poorly implemented. It says everything's downloaded but when trying to play it just freezes."
14098,The app would be nicer if it allowed changing the playback speed as well
14099,"Great opportunity to learn, plus credits if you pay, nothing wrong with that. Excellent delivery and content."
14100,Useful learning tool
14101,I love to recommend Coursera to my Graduate students. They r enjoying their learning from online sessions in Pakistan.
14102,"Me encanta Coursera pero no puedo ver los videos desde la app. Los videos tienen un lag importante, no sincronizan con los subt√≠tulos y cada X segundos se queda congelada la imagen pero el audio sigue. Imposible."
14103,"All round a great application, did learning."
14104,At you own pace.
14105,"One whole week without an update, that's a record! Extra star for you guys..."
14106,Superb  for engineering guidance
14107,Interesante
14108,Coursers is good..now that u can cast to TV. Its awesome!!!
14109,"The last update was real nuisance, but you've got things back to being awesome with this update."
14110,Great
14111,Fine
14112,Good!
14113,App is force closing on my ics device after recent update
14114,I love coursera
14115,This is the first app that I am rating 5 star it's just amazing. You can learn almost anything here and most importantly its' fun learning over here
14116,Very good app.
14117,It's a way you learn not to worry about documenting your knowledge
14118,Self learning very gud. Thanks to coursera
14119,"Is a good app, but cannot download the lecture notes on note 4 or samsung tab s. No help available for this problem. Also notice the g+ link is not fully optimized in these devices either. Note 4 has lollipop and tab 's has kit kat. Otherwise, love the amount of content that is available and it is exactly what I was looking for."
14120,Great courses. Amazing to have this much quality education at my finger tips. Simply wonderful!
14121,"it  is  wonderful ,  my  classes  with  no  stress"
14122,Great!
14123,Stimulating and informative
14124,How to search in a different language ?
14125,"The courses can be tough, but I think that is the point. A beginner's course will not give you the skills you need to go further in your career. As a proactive leaner in the Coursera Community, you really have to push yourself and do the groundwork. I like that challenge. I appreciate the opportunity to add knowledge and skills even if you can't actually get course credit without paying."
14126,"This app is not designed to replace traditional college, if you're looking to gain credits towards your degree then go to university. That should be common sense. This app is for people who LIKE to learn just for the fun of learning and expanding your knowledge. Like Rick's comment, are you seriously complaining you don't get credits for taking these courses? If you are concerned only with working towards a degree then go to college, don't write a bad review. I think this app is great! But I love to learn"
14127,Coursera is amazing.  Great professors reaching great courses. This app is a nice interface to using Coursera. It's great to be able to download video lectures to watch on planes and other areas with poor or no Internet connection.
14128,Everytime I turn the phone sideways/phone auto-rotates all my responses are gone.. At times i get a new question paper
14129,"First version was pretty good. After all these updates it is a nightmare. Somehow this app reduces the speed of my phone so I have to force stop the app to boost it.                                    As long as most of the courses are on demand, you can not download the videos to watch them offline.           And last but not least, you have to use the laptop to pass the exams under verified certificate."
14130,Overall a brilliant app which supports the website very well. The new feature to play videos via Chromecast is great.
14131,Sure it's free... but to get the credit for classes? NOPE. What is the point of this besides wasting people's time??? It's nothing more than a slap in the face to students like myself as it serves ZERO benefit.
14132,Like web there is no section of accomplishments. Also i don't have a webcam with pc can you provide the verification on the app?
14133,
14134,The idea of providing courses online is very good but I have comment! There should be better focus on beginners to learn because I think they're the most using these kind of apps. I wanted to learn programming but the course was pretty tough to learn and and instructor's way in teaching wasn't good for me! Although it was for a beginner!!
14135,I was download all video BT now its not working
14136,"I've taken advantage of this app by fielding videos offline, as well as watching as streaming when I'm behind and am travelling for work, or am commuting to a customer site. Could improve forum interaction. Otherwise, perfect app."
14137,"I first have to say thank you,for sowing knowledge, into the world. There is nothing else I have seen yet that gives to the world with such in-depth focused class's that allow you to pick the courses you want to learn."
14138,Let the learning begin!!! Thank you to everyone who has made this possible. I'm indebted to you for your efforts. :-)
14139,One of the best software & courses
14140,"The first and the best courses online. Easy, fast and relevant information."
14141,"Updated: The app is good enough to get the work done, but could use some work in integrating profile management and allowing people to purchase classes on it as well. Some transactions still have to be done on the website beyond the app."
14142,Loved it
14143,What a great app. I'm always learning new things thanks to this app I can download my course videos and watch me whenever there isn't free minute. May edit: why does this need app history permissions?
14144,The app worked great before the last update. Now it crashes every time I try to load a course lecture. I have tried rebooting my device and reinstalling the app to no avail.
14145,Great learning with great app!
14146,"Prev, Play and Next buttons in the player are too big?"
14147,"I can't open either PDF or DOC, I have to open coursera on a web page."
14148,Nice
14149,Can't access even a single lecture on the app as it stops responding whenever I tap on any lecture to view it. (For the developer's info: I was trying to view lectures of course on Machine learning by Andrew NG)
14150,"Every time  I select a lesson it stops working, fix it please!"
14151,"Nice classes, Great price!"
14152,I enjoy the courier a app; it operates just like the website.
14153,ÿπÿßŸÑ€åŸá
14154,"Everytime I click the link for the readings, it doesn't work so I have to copy-paste it to another site so I can dload it. I do hope it could be fixed. Like just a click of it we can automatically download the pdf."
14155,Source of knowledge
14156,It really helpful
14157,Coursera is a superb site to get all your curiosity sated.
14158,Great app for learning freaks ;-)
14159,It's making sense
14160,"I just downloaded this app today, and I can't open a single lesson. I'm going to give the web version a try before giving up, but I'm currently disappointed."
14161,Really needs a few key features that are in Web version... Most critical is playback spreed. Audio only background playing (or video in window) is a must else it's impossible to simultaneously take notes of view slides
14162,Makes it so easy to access...u don't need the pc to learn...
14163,Does not work for me after update.
14164,"This app is great to use your comute time, but unfortunatly at the moment you turn off the screen or send app to background it stop playback. It would be really useful to keep audio playing becaus slides are important just time to time."
14165,"my mobile internal memory is low so thought moved or download those file to sd card, but failed. this storage issue is urgent for mobile user. Expecting quick asap response."
14166,The great app!
14167,Wow..!
14168,Finally can attempt homework on app also..Thanks people
14169,I welcome the new download feature (that has been around on iOS for long) as it is essential on the go. App in general is getting better. Thanks!
14170,"Coursera is awesome, coursera app is only good"
14171,Deleted after request of additional permissions. But anyway cursera deserves respect
14172,Great app I love it
14173,"I have yet to use this app; I've only used the web version. I thought I would probably use the app, but these permissions to access our contacts, device ID, list of other apps on the phone, and even more are absurd."
14174,Excellent!!!!!
14175,Allows you to do something productive even during traveling
14176,The app asks for too many permissions
14177,Impressive...
14178,Like very much
14179,Good app
14180,Has some bugs
14181,"Love this, made it a lot easier to get through lectures with chromecast. Only problem I have is it occasionally stops mid video and I have no means of figuring out where it stopped (or if the segment is done and I should move to the next one)"
14182,Great app!  Takes online education to another level.
14183,Most recent app update require information access to my browsing history and bookmarks. :(
14184,vgood!!
14185,Very helpful innovation. Thanks for this gem
14186,This app opens you to learn as much courses as you desire.
14187,Easy access to knowledge
14188,Con una sola palabre les describo coursera: Buenisima!!!!
14189,Excellent
14190,Great app
14191,Grt initiative ! Learning on the go!!!
14192,Great
14193,pretty good
14194,It is highly recommended
14195,Loving it
14196,Es recomendable
14197,"Transcripts of the lectures would be nice! Sometimes I prefer to read lessons, or I am in a place I cannot play sound while studying. This would also expand student attraction to deaf and hard of hearing individuals. As previously mentioned, speed control and subtitles (as well as language preference for transcripts, when you add them) would greatly improve app functionality and thus student satisfaction and overall ratings."
14198,Learning on the go!
14199,I don't understand how some ppl are rating this app 1star ... And for the laziest & stupidest reasons.. Get over yourselves.. This is an amazing resource that deserves no less than 4 stars!!
14200,"There is no access to forums or other vital aspects of the course,  which is quite frustrating. I signed up for my first course, thinking I could take it while traveling, only to discover that I could not. However, realizing this, the app is still very useful. I love that I can download lectures to listen to while I'm out and about. Not being tied to my desktop makes it much easier to find the time to get my work done."
14201,"I love Coursera and this is great app, but video player cannot hide software buttons bar. It would be nice if player were using all of the screen space availible, like most of video players do. Playback speed seems to be the feature a lot of people want, and I'm no exception. It's just some lecturers speak so slooow :)"
14202,New courses are not displayed
14203,I have a thousand reasons I think Coursera is great and a hundred ways I wish they would improve. That's a good success rate. The app is a great complement to the online courses.
14204,"If you do a certificate program there's no way to use your phone Web cam to verify your identity, at least on my Samsung galaxy note 4. I had to log into a pc to take the quizzes etc. Other than that it's great for watching the lectures. I do wish there were more options for the discussion board in the apps and acess to reading material.. these things required I go to the full site. So far this app is great for the video lectures and quizzes only if you're not doing a signature course."
14205,"Great effort by the developers. You will need to earn the fifth Star by adding a ""Single Click Download-All"" option for the course videos."
14206,Love
14207,Was super fast
14208,Hat off for your great work.
14209,"Good App ,"
14210,Really useful for academicians and students.
14211,Could have been better
14212,I can no longer view course materials from the app. I am very frustrated.
14213,Helpful
14214,Teacher
14215,Awesome
14216,If only for the  variable playback speed. I need things a little faster.
14217,"This app doesnt allow users to control the video speed like the web page does, among other funcionalities."
14218,Great app! Just like actual college courses.
14219,Perfect
14220,Love it
14221,Very suberb infomatic app
14222,Thank you very much. The app and content is very good. Only problem is that I can't manage to move videos data from internal storage to micro sd card. Is it possible to do so?                                       Edit: thanks...problem is solved with new version.
14223,"The implemented features are very good--lecture videos, course registry--but it would be great to see more. For example, I would love to browse the forums and view assignments and feedback. Also, the videos should have speed controls as in the browser.  EDIT: It's been a year, and still no forum browsing or playback speed controls. Demoting to 1 star, as I have no reason to use this app when the browser version is so much more fully-featured."
14224,"Great app, good content, but randomly closes."
14225,Love the learning experience overall
14226,App was great until the update. Unable to even open course videos after updating. Pl fix asap. Will give 5 stars then
14227,"Can't download Resource material, link do not respond in App,then I download from Website"
14228,Please consider adding video download option for ondemand courses. Would be much appreciated.
14229,It's very powerful leaving app
14230,Good
14231,Must have app
14232,Super app
14233,"Almost perfect , except it hangs sometimes. Can be improved."
14234,Handheld university
14235,good thing is now you can download the videos and save it anywhere  and get it onto your pc ...thanks
14236,"But it does not have an invite system, from what i have seen."
14237,"Nice tutorials but bookmark will be helpful, exercise contents are not appearing.."
14238,It helped me a lot
14239,One of the Best free courses support!!
14240,"I love Coursera and I love this app! Being a busy college student, it can sometimes be a struggle to make time for online courses. Thanks to this app, I now download lecture videos at home and watch them during my daily commute. Efficiency++! I have a small request to the developers. Please add playback speed control in the video player, like in the iOS app. I'm used to much faster speech than that of a lot of the instructors and it saves me time to watch the videos at 1.5x or 2x speed. Thanks and kudos! :)"
14241,Hay tty thank
14242,ÿØÿßŸÜŸÑŸàÿØ
14243,Very helpful and easy to use
14244,It enabled me to pursue my interest in the best possible way
14245,You have to try this.
14246,Will save but not submit answers. Have to use pc which negates the purpose.
14247,Great app to access. Love to learn new things. Nice and very useful update
14248,Keeps closing on some courses.
14249,"Very good app, can watch directly on the app!!    I believe keep learning will gradually change my life n everyone's life!!!"
14250,Really helpful app for learning new technologies.
14251,The ability to download lectures is great!  Edit: I said the only feature I'd really like to see added is the ability to play lectures on a Chromecast.  It turns out that the icon does not show up if there's no Chromecast available on your WiFi network.  Thanks to the devs for the quick reply :)
14252,Excellent
14253,Awesome
14254,"U should try it , Great effort ‚ò∫"
14255,Please add Web designing
14256,To learn is a life time goal
14257,"Unbelievable, shockingly, and outrageous. The greatest online education in the world. Although few lecturers are boring cos they are too old for modern technology teaching. Anyway, you have a choice"
14258,Great app
14259,This app hangs in nexus 5 and also consume a lot of resource
14260,Used it to better understand calculus
14261,I have cimpleted 2 courses using this app
14262,Very useful application.
14263,Please add .1.watching speed .2.arabic subtitle .god job Thanks :)
14264,"Works most of the time, but sometimes can't show video."
14265,"Videos are OK, but no speed control. Main improvement would be forum access"
14266,Good
14267,Loving it...
14268,ÿ™ŸÜ⁄©ÿ≥
14269,"Thanks a lot , Im very keen to learn Forensic Science . hope u will help me for that . Regards. Rehana Gul."
14270,My only complaint is that any accompanying materials cannot be downloaded from the app.
14271,I absolutely love the fact that I am able to access classes from my computer to my phone! It's wonderful!
14272,"I just install this app and when i open it the app crashed, had to uninstall it. Please fix it."
14273,I was only able to view videos and quizzes but other assignments aren't available through the app. Also the forum isn't accessible.
14274,Please add a way to bookmark a course.
14275,Very good app
14276,"I have the same problems: videos are not launching, links are not working, it crashes all the time."
14277,Awesome
14278,"I like the app in general. However, I wish the storage location of course content is transparent. As it happens, I may only have access to this content from other devices only if I root my phone."
14279,"Nice app, but it would be better to continue playing audio when screen is switched off"
14280,The videos don't play in the screen. the problem had been there for some time now and it has not been resolved. horrible .
14281,"it is working worse and worse in the recent weeks. The courses that I have joined do not show up in the app when they started! The app removes the course from my list and I have to join again, or I have to use the coursera webpage. It is getting absolutely useless and frustrating. I miss the app older versions!"
14282,Loved it....  &lt;3
14283,But I would like to be able to see my grades from the app as well
14284,Can't d/l or stream any videos despite wifi on 75/75.
14285,"With the new upgrade this week, I can no longer see the courses I'm enrolled in. I can search, but there is a completely white screen on the Samsung 5.                                          New updates are working much better."
14286,It won't allow me to download it and on my laptop it continously freezes and buffers
14287,Looking rto learning cyber security
14288,keep it up
14289,The most useful app
14290,Superb app
14291,All the best
14292,No longer able to use it in landscape mode. Videos are tiny on phone in normal mode.
14293,Nice aap.. This is very helpful to imprv my knowledge
14294,Why does this app need to use the camera??
14295,A niiiice app
14296,The quiz system refreshes randomly and does not deliver submission to the server. I have lost my completed work twice through this App. I would discourage anyone from using the quiz system on the app. It is good for streaming the lectures though.
14297,"Navigating to find your 'enrolled' courses and videos is frustrating since it is possible to do courses that are not 'active.' Why isn't there any kind of sorting? Like ""most recently watched' ? There is no x1.25 or 2x speed button. Buffering videos takes FOREVER on anything less than a strong 4G signal. A HUGE ""Thank you"" though for pulling out the stupid in-video quizzes when watching on mobile... That was so annoying."
14298,Simply genius presentation and content!
14299,Wonderful to have when on the move.  Thank you for making learning more accessible.
14300,This app is very helpful for students purpose
14301,It's the Haven for knowledge craving people. üëç
14302,DM is too buggy at least in my LG G3! Please fix that as we need to get videos for offline use.
14303,The most productive app
14304,A really good app. It includes so many courses which takes forever scrolling throw. It would be really useful to have a reach function to find what you're looking for.
14305,Please let us move all videos in external storage please make seeting to move all data in external sd my phone starts hanging when i stored many offline data
14306,Thank you Coursea for offering free educational courses.
14307,Amazing app by all means. Thanks a lot
14308,Can't play the video. And also waiting for more functionality!
14309,Why does it not let us participate in group discussion ? There is no option for it. Besides that gr8 app and great organization !
14310,So far everything is good except for one thing - why can't the video lectures start from the last possition? Why do they restart every time you reopen them???
14311,Should have the option of playing videos in external player.
14312,You need to try it to know it :)
14313,It works pretty well....love the site anyways....
14314,Please add a speed toggling button to the vids. Some instructors talk unbearably slow.
14315,Add forum and invideo quizzes support.
14316,Thank you for good to help me grow.
14317,Its very useful for students in order to compete this world in technology.
14318,"Its a really great app but it still needs a few tweaks.  For example, the app could help learners by giving the ability to particapte in discussions, view the required readings and, most importanty, find the downloaded videos in the phones files easily just like when the same videos are downloaded over at the site using PCs."
14319,Awesome app!
14320,Thank you so darn much
14321,The classes are nor open yet and this is week 2.please fix and I promise 5 stars
14322,The best way to study on the move! Love the app!
14323,The app is fantastic. But let me know How to store the videos to external memory. The videos are occupying my internal storage.
14324,Problem solved..ty
14325,Faisalsunka
14326,Very cool
14327,5 stars if the videos streamed smoother...  Lots of buffering
14328,Amazing
14329,"Seems like video's buffering of downloading too slow for me, YouTube works fine. Hope this will be OK soon"
14330,Awesome... :)
14331,Good
14332,Cannot complete quiz within app
14333,Course which I want to study are almost available in different languages other than English so will you please provide inbuilt translation !!!?.
14334,"Very useful for learning on the way. You can view courses content - may be not all of them, but many. Desktop version it's still more convenient, butthis app makes access simpler."
14335,When i first got it you werent able to see the course material but man you can do all that and its to kool
14336,"Nice app for a great site. Sometimes the courses dont appear in the app, but they do apperar in the web version."
14337,"Very handy when I am in the waiting room or otherwise not able to get to my laptop.  I use this on GalaxyTab 4 - 10.1 and LG phone.  Tab is rooted, phone is not.  One thing that is missing that I  would really like to see is access to the discussion boards.  They are an integral part of the learning process in every MOOC I have participated in."
14338,Always learn
14339,Can't open a course
14340,It is the best way to learn
14341,Thanks course and to everyone who made free learning possible!
14342,I can't find the option to download unlike before :(
14343,"The only thing I do t like is it won't allow me to download any of the lecture notes or other downloadable files, only videos. If you can fix that it will be 5 stars"
14344,This Android app does not allow the course content to be viewed; it only shows the course description. I have to access the content via a browser on the desktop. So this app is pretty much useless.
14345,Giving the power of knowledge to the world you are The real gods
14346,"Great app for free ""studying"""
14347,Is this like college but free! Will i get credits and is there something with nursing
14348,Never believed that I could get an advanced degree. Always thought you had to go back to college.        Now I can go to school on my phone .
14349,Excellent app
14350,It's highly useful.
14351,"If u can include a guide section, that can provide a listing of available on demand and scheduled courses from an individuals interest area taking into account the experience level and familiarity with the subject, that would be awesome! Currently I end up taking an advance class before a basic class because I am searching randomly.  Also beef up on demand courses as the collection is pretty useless there."
14352,"Coursera  is a great place to learn new things. Certificates are affordable. Im a broke person who can't afford to continue education at university, but while coursera  certainly cannot replace university education, it is still a good medium through which you can learn. :)"
14353,Love this app. Good.
14354,Really helpful especially for those who cant afford to go bsck to school like me. :)
14355,Im in a situation where I need to study and I have no cash in me.... Im really thankful for the changes and the studies that I earned
14356,Showing can't play the video even after reinstalling it.
14357,Best and easy
14358,Very good
14359,The app works well most of the time when it does work. Does tend to hang though.
14360,should i sign up for something which most probably won't know anything more than what you can usually find by simply searching for it online.
14361,"Subtitle doesn't work in some courses, please fix it!"
14362,Can't find how to increase subtitles text size.
14363,Useful  app
14364,Thanks for this app guys...   Can  study anywhere now...  Great job!!!
14365,Thank you!
14366,Perfect
14367,"Thing that matters, excellent!!!"
14368,Thanks for this great application
14369,"Allows to gain full experience: watch lectures (even with subtitles), do homework, see course logistics and of course browse for new courses. Everything is perfect:)"
14370,Awesome app.... extremely helpful and useful
14371,"We have to use this app to complete quizzes for my AP Calculus class and every single time I work on one of the quizzes for well over an hour, IT DELETES MY ANSWERS. It never fails that it just deletes them all and I have to redo it. It does this on my iPad and my phone. I hate this app."
14372,Very interesting
14373,"First time for me following open courses, thanks for doing and collecting open courses in one app"
14374,Awesome
14375,Can't get the words to explain how wonderful this app is.
14376,All hail Coursera
14377,Its easy way to learn from cell phones great app for education
14378,Its more accessible
14379,Just Download it
14380,Doest work. Nothing else really to say. Dont download.
14381,This app is really very good if you want Lear something... enable video downloading on on demand courses or add some language courses to learn new languages .
14382,Otherwise definitely worth 5 stars
14383,I love this app.  I just finished week one of my first course.  I passed my first quiz 100%. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to further their education whether they want to receive certification or are just wanting to learn something new.
14384,Nice app
14385,"Please, include a easy search by university/country"
14386,I love it....
14387,This is what an online class....superb
14388,Excellent app. Can you please have a folder structure or a good naming convention for files in download Manger? Seriously needed feature.. PLEASE!!
14389,The best app
14390,U can actually learn things here from different categories. All u need to have a good internet connection and interest to learn..
14391,It's what an educational app should be like.
14392,Its difficult to transfer my downloaded videos to my computer
14393,Ilove...
14394,Just crashes when open a course
14395,Don't know if it's just the chem / pharmacy courses but the videos aren't downloading? Other than that it's adequate
14396,E
14397,Can't play the video.
14398,Great
14399,Extremely useful
14400,Unable to download!
14401,Would you please add speed up speed down option on mobile and the ability to pass the signature track as well. It would be very useful.
14402,Learn on the go!
14403,The page My Courses does not work. It is really annoying that after months this issue has not been solved.
14404,Positive psychology
14405,Excellent.
14406,Cant play video. Tell me how to fix it?
14407,Good
14408,but I miss a profile page where I could see my certificates.
14409,But make simplify to view and download video lectures.
14410,Worth it
14411,best ?
14412,Amazing app.
14413,"I had installed it some time back. But even though I have enrolled into new courses, its still showing the old courses"
14414,Tr
14415,Website allows login using FB account and app there is no option using the same. This is a half baked app. Really disappointed.
14416,Thanks to makers of this app and dr. chuck
14417,Best lessons
14418,Really useful app...
14419,Downloading videos feature is awesome!
14420,good
14421,Thnx
14422,I think the ability to take courses and watch videos in the app and also take exams right away in critical for your app. I hope to see those in future releases
14423,The best learning app I could find
14424,"Learning guitar course, coming soon... Bummed, my main reason for install... We'll see what soon means."
14425,The app does what it intendz ie offer the lectures and announcements on mbile. The ability to download videos for offline healps.A liitle more work usability will make it top rate.
14426,I can do now more courses using my phone ! Any where any place ! GREAT!
14427,Superp app...
14428,Its best for learning anything
14429,Unstable app
14430,Thank you developers that added Chromecast support. I am forever in your debt.
14431,Why does it need access to my contacts?
14432,No support for changing playback speed. Often the sound is fine but video hangs. Can't see in-line slides.
14433,Cant connect fb
14434,Please make download to SD card possible. I cannot fit the course I intend to study on my internal memory. That is the only thing that keeps me from giving an otherwise good app 5 stars!
14435,Too bad
14436,Now with Chrome Cast support
14437,"I use this very frequently, though a full web browser session on a real PC is more flexible and a bit more stable. In the stability arena it's mostly the weaker hardware in my old Nexus 7 than the app that is at fault."
14438,!!
14439,"The coursera app was excellent (except for a couple of bugs), but has turned into a disaster as it is not any longer usable for off-line users. And what is this ""Hockeyapp"" all about?"
14440,Nothing better than free education.
14441,Coursera is doing a great work by providing free online training in many specialized courses from top universities.
14442,Tks
14443,"I can once again watch the videos offline, so upgrading my rating to 4 stars."
14444,Really speedy and good UI.
14445,Nice app
14446,Some flaws are inevitable
14447,Where is download video option...???
14448,Can't seem to download videos for on-demand courses.
14449,Please add a full fledged video player with jump forward and jump backward ability
14450,great
14451,I love so much I advice that you must participate on your laptop
14452,There is no justification for the requested access to my contact list. Author disregards that some of the information from our contacts is truly private/confidential. How difficult is this to understand?
14453,Good app
14454,"This app uses HockeyApp lib, which is able to make screenshot from my device!!!! And then send it to somewhere!!!! Uninstall."
14455,Crashes every time while playing video.
14456,"Sir i have a suggestion, your video files are saved as  001.mp4 , 002.mp4,in this way sometimes a conflict is raised, instead of this scheme implement a new video file naming method, For every course assign a unique ID and save video by That ID and The lecture number , suppose if course is from University of Michigan and Course is python then try name like UOM_Python_Lecture1, In this way video will be identified uniquely and even on reinstalling after deletion of app the retrieval of data will be easy. Plz"
14457,This app can read all the accounts in my mobile and all the contacts too. Its ridiculous how much data the developer collects with no transparency. Also the app started taking screenshots of my screen without my consent.
14458,It is addictive.
14459,Better way
14460,Cannot download videos anymore
14461,Seems Good! :)
14462,But i need it on my window phone.
14463,It's a great app. Very useful
14464,More features are missing compared to the web site
14465,Awesome
14466,Great app and quick support.
14467,Best Education App
14468,Nice app for studying...
14469,"Only thing I wish was that we could change the playback speed. I tend to watch videos on faster settings, so I don't use the app as often because of this lacking feature."
14470,Great app. I've been learning so much. I can't access the slides provided. Please fix this and I will give 5 stars.
14471,a career booster indeed
14472,A great app to learn completely free whatever you want
14473,pdf also include in
14474,Great
14475,"I cannot see full sized video during video section, the button on video section is awfully placed, and cannot see / download pdf lecture. Fix for 5 star :)"
14476,I really want to download this app because of its educational benefits but i cant install it here in my Samsung Galaxy Core 2 device. Please fix it as soon as possible.
14477,It's so helpful and curious.
14478,"Awesome app learnt a lot in the last 1 yr, tks coursera for the great lessons"
14479,Dangerous khiladi movie 300 mb in hindi 3GP in 3GP movie ftmovie wolverine
14480,Good for Asians
14481,Learning on web version.
14482,"Downloading the videos on wifi, so you can watch them while away is very convenient. That it suddenly needs access to contacts (with ""Bugfixes"" as the what's new message), is disappointing."
14483,Truly experiencing learning on the go
14484,Everything is good except that I can't attempt quiz while it's Chromecast.
14485,Reality useful
14486,Can't find a way to see what courses r starting soon like I can on the website. Starts on my past courses which is pointless.
14487,"Basic functionality is great. Five stars when they add the option to play videos at different speeds (1.5x etc). You can do this on the website, and generally speaking it makes it poss to get through the material much faster while still keeping it understandable."
14488,Love it.
14489,Educative app
14490,Good
14491,Great!
14492,Its very helpful
14493,Awesome
14494,"VERY GOOD,APP"
14495,"I have to sign in everything I open the app.... Most of the times, my login fails even if right user name and password is given....."
14496,"Because of coursera, microeconomics is the only subject that im gonna get a certain A this semester."
14497,Good experience taking some courses.
14498,Best app i ever had. Luv it !!!
14499,Great app for professional development!
14500,"Love it, really helpful :)"
14501,"I use a proxy to connect to my schools wifi and my apps go through this proxy. When using my mobile data, I was able to read course articles snd watch videos. But connected to wifi. I could only search for courses and read articles. I could not watch the videos. I would be grateful if this bugis fixed Thanks."
14502,Luv it .Best application. Everyone should have it. University education for free.
14503,Loved it
14504,Absolutely amazing device.
14505,It makes everything handier!
14506,Really great very helpful
14507,Education on the Go! Awesome.
14508,God is great may God bless you.
14509,Love it
14510,Your app is bad and you should feel bad.
14511,Makes it possible to fit academics into all of the downtime of my daily life.
14512,My life is changed
14513,I had to uninstall this because it keeps restarting. A real shame because I loved this app but I can't have anything running in the background on my old phone .
14514,I discovered it from my college JMI. And I experienced so exciting.
14515,Awesome!
14516,The quizzed not working yet
14517,if only we could change the download folder toother folder that would be great
14518,"When browsing classes under categories, they aren't sorted by categories."
14519,Awesome and  easy
14520,Works extremely well
14521,Good app for educating oneself on many topics. But why can't I add the on-demand courses to My Courses? I need to dig through the catalogue just to find it every time.
14522,"I'm downloading videos at home, but the app spontaneously signs me out so I can't watch them without internet anyway."
14523,An aplication with usefull
14524,Coursera takes pictures of you when click on the app.
14525,Thanks...
14526,I decided to download the app to see what it was all about and I couldn't even get past the sample quiz. Please fix this!  Moto G
14527,I think the issue was with my storage. I just re-installed the app and it's working fine now. Much better experience and thanks for quick response :-)
14528,Free school and school is cool
14529,Unsubscribed 4 f'ing times and STILL getting SPAM!
14530,"I go through courses videos only with this app. But several technical issues: 1) when I tap ""pause"" during the video, video continues and pauses only after about two seconds, and therefore I often lose some formula for which I wanted pause the video; 2) sometimes videos (voice in it) are to silent even with full volume - seems like volume in your app is lower for some reason than everywhere else. I have android 4.4.2 on Lenovo vibe x2. Also, of course it would be very nice to have in-video quizes"
14531,I love the courses!
14532,Will help you fix it if you like!
14533,keeps crashing after updates on 4th March.
14534,Finally Chromecast works
14535,"Its great browsing through hundreds of courses, but it really needs the ability to star or favourite courses you maybe interested in."
14536,I was going to rate this app at least four stars..... but what hockey app for taking screen shots is doing in the background after latest update? It would be nice to have access to forums.
14537,Good app but how to download
14538,"In addition to all previous ""features"" (periodically forgotten downloaded videos, lack of hi-speed playback, constant crashes) the new version keeps prompting for login every time it runs - REALLY useful when running disconnected (which is my case right now).   UPDATE1: Fixed login issue, then broke again it in the next release.  UPDATE2: Current release doesn't show any registered classes when running disconnected  - discovered it on the plane. (you can still access downloaded content through ""My downloads"" menu). I'm truly impressed with you guys..."
14539,I love that I can do some extra learning on my own at my own pace for free
14540,What's not to like about free learning??
14541,"If I were just rating the courses, it's a five-star app. But a lot of the content won't load within the app. Instead, it opens up in your browser, even though the mobile site is pretty lousy"
14542,Great app with great content!
14543,This is very important app for students. Hats off for coursera.
14544,But we need subtitles plsss
14545,Love the content
14546,It works all right. Needs more topics. Did you know the logo is nearly the same as CoPass?
14547,I love it! I'm using this app to get further knowledge on neuroscience and cosmology. It is really great!
14548,Computer Science 101
14549,"Beautiful design, responsive interface,  fast performance"
14550,Keep building bridges for knowledge and the people.
14551,Very useful service and good app.
14552,You don't need to see EVERYTHING on our devices including our pictures and WiFi info to teach us. Developers are not going to stop doing this stuff until we stop accepting it; I stop now.
14553,Byeeeee!
14554,"A real pity that such a brilliant concept simply does not work in the app. Downloads are not available offline (the main reason I have the app), and with the latest update not even able to open anything anymore with crashes without any reason. Rather stick to the website version."
14555,Thanks for all this efforts to helping us in learning what we want from any place at any time.
14556,Awesome anywhere learning...
14557,"Still buggy, but it is better now. Please fix launching the app in WiFi/cell data off mode. Downloaded material still should be available in this mode. This should be your major feature."
14558,Best and bee
14559,"Trying my first course on it, so far it's good"
14560,Needs a lot of fixes and improvements.
14561,Some video material is being downloaded with audio part only... I will appreciate a lot if you would fix this. Another thing: I don't see a possibility of downloading files to the SD card so I have to move them manually which is quite annoying...
14562,A oasis in desert for self learners
14563,Thanks a lot for an accessing to an amazing free knowledges on my phone!
14564,"I have noticed(including myself) that most of the time we only use our mobile phones for social media and goofing around. Can you imajine what our generations would have done with this technology.  We have everything we want at the palm of our hands, including knowledge.  I am dying to go back to college but certain life events have pulled me back.  With coursera,  I could learn anything. I have college education without the fees.  Someday I will go back to college and for sure I will be more than ready."
14565,"Interface is simple. Although the video player is clutter free, it would be desirable to have features like selecting the storage location for videos, playback speed control, volume and brightness controls on player, etc."
14566,Excellent app
14567,But would be better if you  could add more courses
14568,This is the system that delivers good contents with good system to the whole world on a massive scale. I am really enjoying the lectures on diverse topics offered by coursera. Hope that coursera keep up the good works and improve all the time.
14569,A good app with user friendly interface and good categories also
14570,It's better than a lecturer
14571,Awesome website to learn and so as its app
14572,"World class education, just a touch away."
14573,San
14574,"Stop wasting your time,Start learning by Coursera"
14575,Coursera is great and so is the app.
14576,"I love this app ,have tons of certicates learning in non-stop,take advantage"
14577,Superb app 4 learnerx
14578,Very great
14579,"U guys need to change the name of the app though , people gonna mistake it as a programming exclusive app"
14580,The best app in market for learn about everything
14581,Love it!
14582,Better than working from the PC!
14583,Great app!
14584,Really good and useful
14585,Very educative
14586,The browse feature does not seem to work properly as it returns the same list of courses for all categories
14587,App crashes when trying to access offline videos without Internet connection
14588,Very nice design and user friendly
14589,"I download the app and I only see coming soon , coming soon course."
14590,There's no scope to control the playback speed and the videos don't jump to next video after completion. Crash when trying to use offline.
14591,"I hope that NullPointer exceptions when trying to start app when phone loses internet connection will eventually be fixed (filed a crash report on that).    Besides, one suggestion is could you please stash on-demand courses somewhere at the bottom of my courses list (in ""past courses"") after I successfully pass the course and get credit?  Another suggestion is to  refresh course list only _after_ successful reply with data from server, otherwise with poor inet connection I end up with blank list."
14592,Will not install to my galaxy s4 someone told me about this app and I would check it out if it was to finally install
14593,The app and the service are student friendly and useful.
14594,Almost gave up on this app altogether when I couldn't access my courses for a while but now that its working again its all good. A few extra features would make this app even greater though.
14595,"Why i can't take the quizzes if i'm on signature track?! I have a keyboard and front facing camera in my phone/tablet.. Also, I love the Chromecast integration, thanks for that wonderful feature!"
14596,Was fine until the last update. Now the course pages (syllabus e.t.c.) are all empty. And the app keeps popping up unless closed. Pls help fix it. Thanks.
14597,The App's course browsing options keeps displaying the same courses for different categories. As if I'm looking at the list of all the courses and not a particular narrow set for a specific subject.
14598,"The service and they way it is presented, both are fantastic. They video player has got some issues , when I try to change quality, it does not responds. Using on a tablet. Otherwise a great app and a great work by you guys"
14599,Very convenient and easy to use. Very Clear videos. An excellent app.
14600,"This perfect app could become even better if the useful ""playback speed control"" feature that is available on the desktop web app is added to android app also."
14601,Latest version is crashing often. One scenario is when the network disconnects during play back.
14602,"Was using this app on a Nexus 7. When online it worked perfectly. However, it kept crashing when I tried to watch offline. Hope you can fix this. Thanks"
14603,I have been using this app for last 2 months and it always crashes. I was waiting for the new update hoping that it will be fixed. The apps also restarts on it's own. I have no choice but to uninstall and install again or use force stop. Please help.
14604,Thanks for making this awesome app. It had been my dream to study abroad. But the tuition fee is terribly expensive. But now I can take a great course from ive league online.
14605,The app is crashing when trying to view saved videos in offline mode. It used to be a great app a week ago though
14606,App is crashing in offline viewing mode on Nexus 7. Just started with last update.
14607,Last patch seemed to fix viewing offline videos through the course listing now. Works a treat!
14608,"When browsing, the category you select does not filter, still shows all the courses."
14609,I love coursera and with the app I can learn whenever I like :)
14610,Otherwise i am Greatful it exists at all
14611,"The app can't work offline. It just crashes, and will continue background crashing. The app is updated practically every day, more than probably any other app on my tablet. Maybe have less releases and more testing?"
14612,The courses are very helpful and I learned so many new things. Good to have an app like this.
14613,Good for learning..
14614,"Some of the lessons I watched were popping up questions from previous lessons. Now I'm having trouble watching some of the sub-lessons for a Medical Terminology class I signed up for. I was able to watch the very first intro video but every other video in week 1 is only 15 seconds long and there is no audio, only an intro picture of the school with the teachers name at the top. Please look into these issues."
14615,Cannot open pdf file links
14616,My courses section doesn't get open. It shows a blank white screen..
14617,Great app
14618,"I love the idea of being able to download the videos for offline viewing, but the app crashes when it loses connection!! Please fix. It is a great app to follow the courses while commuting on the train. :-)"
14619,And a brilliant platform all together.
14620,"Can you add a function that lets people add upcoming courses onto a wish list or as a favourite, ideally with notifications closer to when they will commence? Thank you."
14621,"Like this app. Despite all the stuff tucked in here, works smoothly. Love the content."
14622,Thank you for the update. Videos work perfect. Still some videos of some courses play only audio.
14623,The application is not complicated
14624,I can't open assigned readings pdf. When i click on them nothing happens
14625,"Can't login with account, though it works fine on website.  And most classes are 'coming soon'"
14626,"This application seems to be unfinished mostly because the weird implementation of things like tabs, I haven't understand why it doesn't have a swipe gesture to navigate through them. There's also a little detail when you open the navigation drawer and is that the 3 lines in the action bar doesn't move."
14627,The app should have the discussion forum integrated with it.
14628,You can't use the app without an internet connection.  It will log you out and when you finally get a connection it will force you to retype your credentials which is not fun on a small tablet.   I can't log in now for some unknown reason.
14629,Really changing the way we learn things
14630,Great app but it would be nice if we could control where the video downloads are being saved (device storage vs SD card) since videos do take quite a bit of space!
14631,From coursera staff: try signout then signin. Works for me!
14632,"I really like this app but recently it started log out and after restart there have been lost all my downloads. Fix it up, please."
14633,"Handy for downloading and watching lecture videos, but doesn't really work offline or with a weak internet connection."
14634,"Chromecast support was critical for me, and they brought it back. I use this app to watch lectures on my TV using Chromecast.  Its perfect."
14635,Really nice app!!!!
14636,"Previous version was more stable and robust, the latest version has lots of bugs and crashes. The most annoying aspect is that I have to provide my login credentials every time I start the application. Can you provide a way to rollback to the previous version."
14637,Just started let's hope it goes well.thanks for the apotunity
14638,Why do you require camera permissions?
14639,"I used this app a lot last year and found it really useful. However, something awful has happened in the last update, and I have now uninstalled the app. Since the last update, the app now launches itself without warning. Literally every time I unlocked my phone today, the app was open. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I have closed down the app eight or nine times, and yet every time I unlock my phone, it's right there. It's massively annoying. I don't want an app to open without warning. Uninstalled."
14640,It has been working since I downloaded this app but it doesn't appear now please try to solve this as I need the app most of time.
14641,Love being able to go offline for days and still exhaust my brain before the downloaded lectures run out. Auto content preload? Assignment and video lecture scheduling (one-a-day)? Flashcards/quizzes?
14642,Excellent app for education. But  frequently signing  out from log in. I hate this .
14643,A+
14644,The idea behind coursera is anonymous. But the app was big disappointment since it lacks lots of major essential features that are present in it's website.
14645,You're making life better and learning easier for us... Thank you
14646,"Camera and contacts permission, seriously?"
14647,"It's a very nice App that help me keep track of my progress on the courses, get updates on them and download videos for offline watching.  I would like to suggest a single feature: - Add a configuration option to let the user (optionally) watch the videos with an external video player app (while keeping track of the course progress). Most people are used to their video players,  and some offer good features that help on watching the classes."
14648,New permissions added without explanation
14649,Awesome
14650,Love this app.. Just one question: how many times in a day is this app updated?? (LOL) keep doing the good work guys!
14651,"After last update, I can't use it anymore. Thanks..."
14652,Recent update seems to have fixed the bugs. My courses are showing up again.
14653,Great app which allows you to interact with online course at the touch of your fingers
14654,Usefull
14655,Need to improve more.
14656,Courses will now load. Thanks
14657,Thanks A lot
14658,Can't download pdf and txt files. Why is that? Nice work on fixing previous issues.
14659,"I really like this program. The courses are rigorous and effective. I would give it 5 stars if I could take quizzes and upload assignments in app. Also, it would be great if I could verify assignments with my tablet or phone's front camera. Little things to be sure, but would be nice."
14660,Nexus 5
14661,"With the recent update, we need to login before watching videos. Why can't we watch lecture videos offline? What's the point of downloading videos to your phone then?"
14662,Update today seems to have corrected issues with my courses not showing up on app. Thank you !!
14663,Asks for but doesn't need contacts. Doesn't even try to explain permissions grab.
14664,ÿÆŸàÿ® ÿ®ŸàÿØ
14665,So've it
14666,Why is the app not available in Colombia?
14667,"Can't see the courses, can't search..."
14668,better
14669,It only works after cleaning data
14670,I'm not sure the issue people are having but clearing data and cache after an update fixes things for me.
14671,...and still not working.
14672,"Nexus 5, android lollipop."
14673,I love this app. I try to watch lectures at work but since I don't get any data at work I download it at home but there's no point since I keep getting logged out when I close the app and I need data to log in to watch the videos I downloaded beforehand.
14674,After updating this app it has stopped working and shows error
14675,Prefect app for life long learning
14676,Systematic and variety of opportunity to make mobile a learning tool.. excellent app.. but cannot get into discussions.. wish that was possible using this app
14677,It is still the best edu site. But this app is completely broken
14678,"there were several more updates, I auto-install them, but it doesn't help still.  Specifically, currently it allows browsing and searching courses, but doesn't show my courses (both current  and past, just blank page). Clearing data and logging in again didn't help.  On my other device, android phablet, I didn't update it for a while, and older version still works. So, if you have backup, you can use it."
14679,Why the last update need a permission to access my contacts!!! uninstalled
14680,"Please please fix the logout problem with the latest version. Every time I close the app now I have to login again, which means I can't view offline lectures if i don't get a signal. With Nexus 4. Thanks! [Edit: And you've fixed it! That was very quick. Thank you so much!]"
14681,Good. But broken now. The 'My courses page doesnt load now. I.e doesnt show my courses'
14682,Really like this app. I can access all my courses and information as well as the videos. Great :-) :-)
14683,The application is awesome but after the latest update it does not load my courses.
14684,The app does not list my courses anymore
14685,"The app and it's functions are great, but when I log I, it doesn't show my courses anymore. Any way to fix this please!"
14686,Is not working :c I can't see my courses
14687,Its just refreshing and the list is empty
14688,After updating to the latest version it doesn't list my course any more when I login.
14689,The app is pointless if I can't view any of my courses.
14690,I love the app
14691,This new update doesn't work for me. My courses can't open. Loads endlessly. Plz fix.
14692,Its okk
14693,"Empty screen on my classes, can't watch video of current subscriptions"
14694,After this update not able to see my courses and also can't see the lecture videos.
14695,"Amazing app, just need to fix some downloading issues"
14696,One of the most important & valuable applications which really helps anyone
14697,Great when away from my pc
14698,I had the same problem with the spinning bar of death.  I logged out and back in and everything repopulated
14699,The app has much to improve:  Access to assignments through the app would be appreciated. alerting multiple times that there's no connection every time I open the app or perform any actions in it- even if I just want to watch downloaded videos offline is useless and quite  annoying.  Last update fixed logout bug - (re)added 2 stars.
14700,"I love online education start ups like Coursera, and the ideas behind this app, but it's beta stage at best. Several things can't be done inside the app, only watching videos works(and you miss out on the in video quizzes.) It also cannot save login information- you have to log in every time you open it. They have a perfectly functional mobile site, just use your browser instead imo"
14701,Devote 2-4h/w and you could learn many new things through their video tutorials.
14702,"I would love to use this app, but none of the courses will load properly. All I get is a white screen that is continously loading. Looking at the reviews, I'm not the only one having this problem."
14703,for questions that contain tables they are not displayed correctly. Usually just on one line You can't figure what the table is. For the eg the new data science course from uiuc
14704,I use all time on subway and commute and in gym.  Happy fixed logout issue which solved subway issue!
14705,Courses don't load. Non functional app.
14706,Course page just spins infinitely.
14707,Why it  needs access to my contacts.?
14708,"""My courses"" will not load. Nexus 5."
14709,A very good app for learning.
14710,Nice app
14711,This is a great app. The only challenge now is I have to sign in every time I open the app. Which is kind off a worry to me. Fix that for 5 stars
14712,I cant watch videos offline now as you now have to constantly log in and you need a network connection to do it... making offline viewing if courses impossible and the abolity to download course videos to watch offline redundant.
14713,Love the site. I'm sure the app is great
14714,Would have given a 5 star if the app also include the forum feature
14715,"The interface is friendly to use and easy to move through different courses. I like everything about the app except the part where I have to sign in to my account each time I open it. This problem has been recurring after the recent update. If this can be fixed, it'll be greatly appreciated."
14716,Wonderful app
14717,The latest version needs logging in every time it is opened. Not ideal especially when being used offline. There really should be an option to rollback apps to last previous version.
14718,Why does it require me to login everytime? It used to retain my login session..
14719,Fantastic way to learn on the run
14720,"After the previous update, every time I reopen the app after using it, it asks me to log in again. Fix it, it used to be okay before."
14721,"More courses, the rest is ok"
14722,Needed also a pin - to pin a course i  saw and like it to be pined for next time...
14723,"Really nice app, but the new glitch with needing to log in everytime you open the app is a big hassle."
14724,I have tried to install this app several times the last few weeks.  No luck
14725,Login each time?
14726,Used to be 4 stars...now it wants too many permissions.  Can't think of any good reason this should have access to my contacts list.
14727,"Don't play subtitles to Chromecast, don't save in external memory, navigation can be improved... It's a work in progress..."
14728,El mejor MOOC
14729,Great for offline viewing lectures and materials. Keep up the good work.
14730,Every update broke something that worked before! I think most of us need this app to just watch videos offline and we can't!
14731,This new update prompt me for my login details every single time I close the app.
14732,"2-More filtering features, 3-Push notifications"
14733,"Old version was better,. New version so painful, anytime I open this app, log in again.."
14734,Browsing for new classes is unintuitive and messy.
14735,But auto logs out on this version. Typing password a pain and can't watch downloaded videos offline
14736,Why does Coursers need access to my contacts? Can you please explain this?
14737,Links doesnt work.. App is good..can b better
14738,Cool app
14739,Aalliee
14740,–ü—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ —É–∂–∞—Å–Ω–æ —Ç–æ—Ä–º–æ–∑–∏—Ç –∏ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–Ω–æ –≤—ã–ª–µ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç
14741,I think learning for free with Coursera is a wonderful opportunity.
14742,I love the interface and everything but I think app updates should be pushed weekly /monthly.
14743,I think Coursera is wonderful.
14744,This is a great idea but the app doesn't need access to all of the things it pokes it's digital nose into Limit its access to only what it needs to function and I'll reconsider.
14745,Love the lectures. No complains.
14746,"Before I could even use it the first time, it needed an update that required access to my entire contact list. No thank you. Uninstall."
14747,"It sort of works, but has extremely poor functionality and a lot of bugs. A lot to be done."
14748,If icon is more small. It will be prefect!
14749,Yes! yes!
14750,The best one!
14751,"I don't mind the app bugging me but I won't have it bug my friends, family, and coworkers.  Bad move, Coursera.  I'm gone for good."
14752,Great way of learning with ease of access
14753,"Mostly good, but videos cannot be sped up (unlike watching web version on desktop). Biggest problem: It autostarts and uses RAM, which is the unforgivable sin for apps."
14754,Your site version is much faster and easier than app!! But still i love it!!!!:) the best!!!!!!!
14755,moto x 2014 with 5.0
14756,Amazingly awesome
14757,Would be much better if contains all the features of the website.
14758,"I love that I have the opportunity to go to a class without bring in one, with it being right on my phone. Great app. Great schools.  Great opportunity to expand your mind!!!"
14759,After watching 1 video full. I pressed back button and I was in course list page but automatically other video was started were I left. After doing force stop from setting the vidoe/app was stopped.
14760,"I can't download the app! It's keeps saying error downloading, can someone help me?"
14761,Doesn't work. Doesn't load any of my courses
14762,Opens the door to online learning from the World's top Universities
14763,Wonderful pool of knowledge for everyone
14764,New update is wholesome as it brings in the quizzes to mobile-OS.
14765,Excellent concept and execution.
14766,"Great, however I'd like to see the ability to ask questions per video like on the website"
14767,Great supporting app
14768,"It is an amazing Web. Because it intoduces a collection of  high ranked universities from U.S. and I think from other countries.  Also it gives a lot of courses from many fields. So, it is a good app for  serious people who like to learn new skills and a new knowledge."
14769,Everyday is a learning day. So everybody download this app and apply it to your everyday routine. Enjoy learning Godbless us all.
14770,"Great way to learn new stuff, and its free."
14771,Thank you coursera team for making this wonderful app! Your goal to help people get free education is remarkable and this app is definitely doing that well.
14772,Fantastic for learning and useful knowledge.
14773,Wh00p wh00p chromecast is back :)
14774,"This is a wonderful idea, and preforms it's job perfectly."
14775,Awesome!! Great app and love what you guys do.Maybe access to forums would be something to look into?
14776,This app is amazing!
14777,I get to take so many amazing courses and most of them are fun. Surely beats actually going to universities
14778,You can better yourself everyday for free. One should never stop learning and with Coursera it's possible for you to obtain more knowledge to become a better you.
14779,Best app ever
14780,I was hoping to be able to access my courses.  But I can't access anything with this app.
14781,Good vehicle for learn something new on mobile but not good for those who take Signature track course.. .(Chris)
14782,So much for free time!
14783,"It used to be a great thing,  but does not work any more"
14784,Good App
14785,Cool~ ^^‚ô°
14786,Excellent app
14787,"Now I'm not able to see the My Courses page, which was working before"
14788,Its great.
14789,Recently the app is not working properly. I cannot access my course. I am re-installing the app.
14790,Please introduce option to download videos for On-Demand courses. Choice for video quality will be also useful.
14791,loved it
14792,"Can watch lectures, but that's about it"
14793,"Even after successful login,  it keep saying sign up or login.  Unable to access ""my courses"" please fix asap"
14794,"Completely Useless. When trying to play a video, all I see is the title of the video across the top of the screen, below which is nothing but blank white. It doesn't matter which video I attempt to play."
14795,Will be much better if video player would has lock function or background options like mp3 player. Needs when you bicycling or running.
14796,It showing me subtitles of different  course for different course video
14797,Good
14798,I cannot watch my courses. It doesn't load anything.
14799,"This app has the same knowledge that you can find for free online. If you cannot find what you need, ask me on Twitter @piggybear1987 I will be glad to help you find something Free to replace this paid bull crap."
14800,It's a good app to a great website but it lacks the speed option on the videos that I think is a must to have.
14801,Nice app
14802,"Not giving 5 * as on downloading content for offline study, its consuming phones internal memory where as it would be best if it saves it on external memory."
14803,It's free knowledge can't beat that.
14804,Would like to see more self-paced courses
14805,"Now i can feel, I'm living in the new century. Free education and reachable. Very well done üòäüëç"
14806,Lvling
14807,Chromecast support returned!  Enjoying watching classes on big screen.
14808,Lov
14809,I really like this application
14810,Its an ok app. Why I can't access my courses via my google account. It will be good if I can do it.
14811,Cant sign in
14812,Great app. Love the flexibility and convenience.
14813,Awesome free app. Not the greatest course selection but can't complain since it's free
14814,RAD  @  UNC
14815,It worked with Chromecast for a while. I suspect support for device was removed after update. Reintroduced then dropped again. Why oh why?
14816,Empowering
14817,Chiabe
14818,We can learn everywhere
14819,It would be nice if it could set reminders for assignments etc. wishlists would be awesome too!!
14820,I love this app for accessing my courses. However would love the ability to choose where to save the downloaded video files instead of having them fill my internal memory. Also the ability to view assignment deadlines and other critical functionality that is available on the web version would be a welcome update! Thanks Coursera for educating the world for free!
14821,Cool app good or learning
14822,"Sir , can u tell me how to do assignments on the app"
14823,Super
14824,Best app ever!!!
14825,Absolutely wow!!!
14826,"i like the app a lot. however, i cnt open it for several days. i hope that u fix the bug immediately. i missing my lessons. :("
14827,Very good for who looking for learn any time in life!
14828,"It does some things great - like let you easily watch the lecture videos, but other things just don't work.  For example, I'm on week 2 of a course, but it is only displaying the material for week 1."
14829,I like this app and it is helpful in pursuing the course anytime anywhere. But it access through the browsers sometimes and asks for the login details again that sounds weird.
14830,loved it
14831,"For the new update, if the 'my courses' section seems to load forever, go to your phone's setting, then 'app' (android), then coursera. Clear the cache. Your courses should be able to load. Warning....you will lose all previously downloaded videos. The interface for this update is sleek by the way"
14832,This app may learn about worlds best education.....
14833,"Great app! Nice design and works well. A few important features missing: 1. Browse and comment in forums, 2. Download lecture slides 3. Speed up video lectures playback. Thanks!"
14834,App is a pleasure to use
14835,"I can not view any courses after logging in to my account under my Coursera app. Even i can not find  support customer service to contact to resolve problem. I hope after looking at this review, someone should respond. Please look at reviews and respond and solve problem."
14836,Thank you...
14837,Very useful
14838,"Hi devs, there's this bug that whenever I play offline videos, with subtitles enabled, a white overlay covers the video. Even with the subtitles disabled when the player bar is being shown i.e. by touching the screen, the overlay happens again. My device is galaxy note 3 android 4.3!"
14839,"Excellent resource although limited in some faculties. Could do with a ""bookmark function"",  to bookmark courses one intends to do in future."
14840,Gave correct info to sign in email and password... To no avail... keeps asking to check both.. Have done so... but app refuses to log in.!!??? No problem on my computer though.
14841,I wish the app could save appdata on ext SD....it becomes a huge problem for phones with low internal memory
14842,Amazing
14843,I love it and recomend this app.. wow
14844,Awsm app...I want this app.. atlast I want this....
14845,Wow
14846,"I really need the following functions:   First one is the multi-window support. I prefer to watch videos in a train and I need to do some notes during that (because it's not a movie, it's a learning process), it's really annoing to switch beetween 2 applications all  the time, because Coursera doesn't support multi-window mode. Another way - to watch videos in a browser, but then this application is useless... (for me).  And the second one, not so critical, but it'd be great: the possibility to download not only videos, but also slides and so on."
14847,Aswome
14848,Grt app..but some time facing prblm while  downloading  videos
14849,"I'm unable to play videos, on my lg L7 dual, plz fix it. ."
14850,Now can I login using my google account¬ø getting closer!
14851,Please add an option to limit downloads over WiFi only
14852,"On my Lg G2, cannot even log in. Does not let me hit the log in button.  Broken..."
14853,"Not only a great way of accessing this resource, but very quick recognition of an issue, response (unexpected, thank you!) and resolution."
14854,Makes learning easier
14855,I love it! Do you have plans to support video streaming to a Chromecast enable device?
14856,Good
14857,A plus
14858,Amazing
14859,Inexpensive high quality on-line learning.
14860,Great!!! Very. Detailed
14861,Great
14862,Its working perfectly fine now. I just have to reinstall it. Great learning app and I enjoy using it. Got tons of useful courses. Would recommend it to my friends. Giving it a five star !
14863,Excellent course
14864,simply perfect
14865,Courses wont load
14866,need to add pop-up quiz inside lectures
14867,"The app is great, but after a while it stopped showing my courses. It launches,  I can access downloaded materials, can search and browse, but I can't see my current courses and so can't get to materials that I didn't download. Please fix it, please! I don't have enough time to study at my desk on laptop."
14868,Great app!
14869,Please add support for more than 1x playback. Also it would be nice if the app reopened to my last course.
14870,Can't change video playing speed!
14871,"'Was wondering what I'll be doing after graduation, this app just came with the perfect answer! Very good for those who can't stop seeking knowledge.  Hoping for more courses and they should make it possible to access all other features like forum, colleagues etc without getting to the desktop site. ...was glad for the app but it takes quite long to load and so, it's kinda boring!!!"
14872,I have always loved it.
14873,"It is doing what it has to do. Firstly I had problems with architecture of the app and activites tree (there is a ""main"" screen with my courses, which is parent of all activities (""pages"") - what is a bit confusing)"
14874,I have HTC one m7. Chromecast function can not working even it can connect - chromecast- by another applications normally
14875,awesome  apps
14876,Coursera really lived up to my expectations. It's awesome and recommend every student to install it.
14877,Fantastic aap
14878,How to download course videos please help
14879,Great App!
14880,Can't play videos
14881,Great app
14882,"Terrific courses offered. Something for everyone. Most require no previous knowledge. You can do as little or as much as you like. Even with advanced degrees, I find the courses interesting and challenging!! I hope some day they can offer a Degree Program. They have the courses."
14883,"Simple ,Clean and Effective"
14884,Like this app
14885,Gateway to great courses.....
14886,But not on the app . Videos isn't working .
14887,"Just an idea and implementation are already very good. Thank you. I find missing: 1) more filtering options (language, dates, duration, more detailed categories or tags); 2) playback speed control (some of the lecturers speak so slow that I hardly manage to stay awake, could easily play at 130% of speed at least without losing a point), 3) wishlist or other bookmarking system."
14888,Thank you Coursera Team for the hard work.
14889,Perfect place leisure learning
14890,Cool app useful and practical
14891,Loved it .
14892,AMAZING
14893,Course is amazing
14894,A good example of Distance / online learning
14895,"Great app giving huge opportunities! I only regret ability to speed up videos, that is already present in IOS version. Please, please, add it!!!"
14896,I heard from freinds its amazing and best
14897,"Until Friday this app worked across the listed devices on the following providers:  Century Link WIFI, Verizon Wireless,  and AT &T wireless.  At approximate 9:01 pm, PST,  Friday, 30 January 2015, classes ceased to download and stream.  Text copies of the captions stopped downloading successfully.  The default Android browser which used to stream and download lost its support and  chrome and Chrome Beta are not working with video and text streaming and download.  Quizzes are not accessible."
14898,Not every course is available on this app. There  is also  no  playback  speed  control  like  in the  website. Lots of usability problems.
14899,"Good, but sound during videos is too low"
14900,I've been a fan of this since it was released there you can find lots of educational content
14901,"At risk of sounding egocentric, it seems that the app is being updated around the on demand courses that I'm taking, so I can take the quizzes without using the web browser! Whatever the case is, thanks guys üòÄ"
14902,"Nice &keep it up sir , nice journey,  sir ,THANK YOU sir"
14903,"I've lost all the answers twice to the test I'm taking and it's frustrating. The app just does not work properly. I'll have to retake the test on the web page. For me, the app is useless."
14904,"Comfortable, enjoyable learning."
14905,bettered
14906,Thanks for making chromecast support work again!
14907,I really enjoy Coursera and the quality of this App. It helps you keep going your courses when your are not at home.
14908,"Very detailed app. Easy to download files. Only thing lacking is the ability to add courses to 'Wishlist' or look out for 'Future Sessions' of a particular course. Also, add option of sorting the courses while browsing. Please fix the issue."
14909,Great
14910,With Cromecast support back it is again a great app
14911,Better than edx
14912,Love to learn with this app
14913,"This idea is still in its infancy, but Coursera has definitely got it moving in the right direction.  In due time I think the paid verifications could start to gain clout from a r√©sum√© perspective and could put higher education in the hands of anyone with the will to learn.  The app itself works great and facilitates one of the world's best ideas."
14914,I love Coursera. Great app. High quality course content. Top notch.
14915,"Whenever I try to join any courses , it showss ""a retrofit error"" . Please take note of this bug and find a solution."
14916,Great
14917,App is good ....but what is default location for storing the downloaded videos ....my course videos consumes app storage ..but default storage is external SD card.....               Update: problem solved
14918,Big thanks to Coursera team for all the knowledge it gives us ! Great app
14919,I cant see my courses after update. Also on-demand courses don't open. Always loading but nothing happen.
14920,It utterly astounds me when I think about the immense amount of knowledge available for free through this app. Keep up the good work.
14921,Hmm
14922,"Great courses, not the clearest app"
14923,Truly i loved it..!! One mst take full fleshed advantage as he she can get non stop learnimg inline experience for any subject of his or her choice n dat also free...!!
14924,interested & inteligent
14925,"The unenroll process in the app does not work properly. It gives me an error when unenrolling. I logged on to my computer and I am not in the class, but still getting emails and, the class continues to show up in the app. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app to no avail.  Please fix."
14926,Needs chrome cast.
14927,Cool
14928,"Edit: Chromecast is back, and so is my daily use of the app! ////   The app was near perfect, but when you removed Chromecast support it ceased to be useful to me. Won't really have a use for the app until it is implemented again. Listen to your customers, and don't regress on a key feature. Old rating: 2 stars."
14929,Nice App...
14930,It would be helpful if classes could be displayed one of two ways - alphabetically or starting date.
14931,"I love Coursera courses, and the app is great too.  It's cool that it supports Chromecast, so you can watch the lectures on your TV, the only thing that is missing in this mode are subtitles."
14932,"Have problem with the video in my tablet Samsung GT 5112. If the video is paused for quite a long time, half a minute at least, than   the video does not  unpause, the error appears, so I've to start the video againe"
14933,Awesome! Helps a lot to carry videos offline.
14934,"The app has sync problems and video pause and play problems. Also, there are very frequent updates"
14935,Gut
14936,I cannot see the video in course Functional Programming Principles in Scala
14937,Thank you for helping me in building my skill sets everyday...with lots of love and respect....
14938,A very good programme learning
14939,Thanks for your efforts in making a nice app to help us all. Would appreciate if you add a feature of exporting the downloaded videos so that we can copy them on a laptop as well
14940,Great
14941,Unable to search or view my courses.  I have videos downloaded but the courses do not show.  Used to work great
14942,Thank you for bringing back chromecast support.
14943,"Almost everything about the app is fine, but Search on the other hand doesn't work. I can't search for the classes I'm looking for."
14944,"The search feature doesn't work, so can't find what I'm looking for."
14945,Can't login
14946,Great application
14947,There is no option for downloading videos. Please fix it. Thanks!
14948,Really useful! Loved!
14949,Much awaited app on Android
14950,"It's really good to have an app like this. However, I would really like the app to have the discussion forums integrated into it. That would be an awesome enhancement to the app."
14951,Works perfect
14952,I turned on subtitle of the program and found out that it appeared on my phone instead on my tv. Not sure how i could watch day video on tv and read the subtitle on my phone at the same time.
14953,"Cannot change video player speed (x1.5, x2...) although it is mentioned as a feature in the courses, and it is available on the web. Please fix this."
14954,Just love this app.
14955,"Couldn't sign in, so it was worthless to me, unfortunately."
14956,"Installed the app on my samsung tablet without any problems.  Logged in, got access to my courses and watched some videos. App then crashed and it never worked again. Tried re-installing but made no difference, can't see anything on it now."
14957,¬°Qu√© gran noticia esta! Esto s√≥lo lo permite el avance tecnol√≥gico y disposici√≥n y buena voluntad de las universidades. Gracias. J.P. Torres.
14958,So glad this app is available. Now its very practical for my courses
14959,"Nicely done; everything I need, even the possibility of downloading lectures from courses taken long time ago. This app is even better than taking courses over a desktop or laptop..."
14960,Knowledge in the pocket... Everywhere you go... Easy :)
14961,With the latest update it constantly asks me to sign in and each time I do so it says I have no enrolled courses which is not true.
14962,"Finally, a proper Coursera app!"
14963,Nice idea and app
14964,Learn so much with this app
14965,Thank you for the chromecast support. Please add more native quizzes.
14966,An example of M-education. Good way of imparting knowledge.
14967,Convenient
14968,Excellent app and course
14969,education for life time.
14970,Coursera is ofcourse d best1
14971,Trying to submit for a class and got a retrofit error
14972,Nice but still not comparable to web version...  Too many features missing..  Also a little too buggy.!!
14973,This is the one of the best platform for Higher Education without paying one penny.
14974,Excellent learning source
14975,Perfect for the insatiable learner!
14976,I'm really missing opportunity to play faster movie. For some courses it's fine to have 1.5x faster because presenter is speaking really slowly.
14977,Good
14978,Encouragement and incredible
14979,Best way for measuring your self...
14980,Amazingly work nd so much helpful :)
14981,Never used coursera before because I do not like to watch videos on my computer. Chromecast support completely changes that. Will tune you every evening.
14982,Can't play the video.
14983,I'm taking the bethovan sonata course and it works well.
14984,You can become a better professional by taking one of the many free courses! Awesome!! Thank you so much!!!
14985,This is a very helpful app that allows me to stream the video to chromecast. Nice job guys!
14986,Introduction  to  Marketing
14987,Very good
14988,On web you can speed up or slow down the video. Why is this impossible in the app?
14989,Best interface
14990,"*only Course General Page*   Sorry for being negative, because I really appreciate Coursera, as a service. But this App is flawed, in my experience. I am using a Nexus 5 with Android version 5.01(Lollipop).   Usually, the content does not fit the screen at all, in scale. and the Videos do not play, tried both html5 and flash (note that the videos do play when using the Chrome web-browser, on the same device.) Also, there is quite a lot of overlapping text occurring.   I hope this gets better in time."
14991,"The login is not remembered, which is ultra annoying when coupled with a crashing app."
14992,Not a big fan of applications always wanting me to sign up. Yeah I get it.. But why not preview first?  Then decide if it's for me or whom ever?
14993,Good
14994,"New version is disaster. I lost all my courses, and search is not working ."
14995,For learning new concepts
14996,Prior knowledge needed not mentioned
14997,Uninstalling until you fix it.
14998,Please add support for immersive mode full screen video for devices that use software buttons rather than physical ones.
14999,"The app is great for catching class on the run, but returning the option to view on the big screen is an excellent return to form."
15000,Truly wonderful
15001,Liked the Chromecast support!!
15002,Very helpful!!
15003,good
15004,Very good app..
15005,Loved support for chromecast
15006,very convenient
15007,"Buggy as hell. Best one is when you hit Logout and it says ""you must log in to access this feature"" (login doesn't work btw). Needs a LOT of work before it's anywhere near usable. Maybe they should take their own course on android programming. If they can access it."
15008,Chromecasting is working again.
15009,App doesn't stream videos. Only audios are streamed for any course I go through. I am having S-duos (4.0) which doesn't support HD videos. Please fix this error. I don't think coursera team even read these issues. This has been the issue for a very long time now.
15010,It is ok but quite slow. Another problem I found is video. The videos are not shown whereas voices of the professors are heard. And there is no any type of button to change codecs.
15011,It should give notifications before the assignments and when the new videos are available. iPhone like Signature track verification is also badly needed!
15012,Such a great app.
15013,"Awesome app, but lacks playback controls. Would love it if the app allowed me to increase the play speed for slow lectures."
15014,Please bring back Chromecast support.
15015,Glad they added Chromecast support. The only issue is that some of the assignments can't be done in the app and require a PC. Fix this and I'll give it a 5. Offline video viewing is also very helpful.
15016,Error is found in after doing the exercises I cannot return to the lecture list. There is no any link.
15017,Very user friendly app!
15018,Great app
15019,Loved it !
15020,good
15021,Wonderful learning resource
15022,Auto restarts hundred times a day
15023,I really liked it. Nice interface and very reliable.
15024,Chromecast is back! Yay!
15025,Finally Chromecast is back!
15026,I cannt join one class.Show error 401.And even i join it from PC. I still cannpt see the course list in my phone!
15027,Improve search features wish advance search options. 2. In app course material reading including pdf files. 3. Integration with cloud for opening excel docs et al should help.
15028,The app is not fully optimised for Android Lollipop.  It crashes frequently and shows ANR dialogue. Please fix it.
15029,I wish it would let me access the downloaded videos folder so I can save the videos on another devices. Sometimes people don't have enough storage or would like to review the video material.
15030,"I love coursera because I can check out classes and career fields I other wise would have avoided because college is expensive!  The layout has yet to be beaten by any other app of its kind in my opinion, very reliable too!"
15031,"Would be nice to be able to change playback speed, especially when quickly reviewing content."
15032,I would use this app more if it worked properly. Every time I try to enroll into a class there is some error code. I have not been able to use the app at all. The website is awesome tho...
15033,"I am able to log in using my mail ID and password, when I am using coursera from my laptop, but not able to log in using the android App on my HTC one M7."
15034,Thxs for subs :)
15035,How do I recover my password?
15036,"The more knowledge you share the more it grows! This is a brilliant way of not limiting education in four walls, but reaching our to millions of yearning students! Kudos!"
15037,Awesome app to learn
15038,Awesome
15039,"great app,  I hope in the future they make sm with arabic language"
15040,Really helpful
15041,Very good assistant
15042,I learn through coursera since 2014 in pc. now in android
15043,Works great
15044,Knowledge is every thing
15045,Can u add forgot password link in login page. Tks
15046,"Well, great app to catch up on the lectures, but I still feel the need to go back to PC to do some serious reading or attempt the quiz."
15047,Coursera is amazing! I've already taken a few courses on it. A great app for inquiring minds!
15048,Very nice app for learning.
15049,My favorite
15050,Its the good stuff
15051,"I would love to access my courses, but the download stops at 87% no matter what I do. Please fix this bug and I will fix the rating once its working"
15052,"Previous version was good. In new version, Chromecast option was removed.  Please add that feature back."
15053,"Wow what a Great App. This App is so Full of Vital Information for Millions of Everday People to Business,  and Company's definitely a 5 Star App. This is what makes the Google Play Store so Valuable to Everyone.  Fantastic App. Timothy Cline Union City Indiana."
15054,awsome app!
15055,Needs Chromecast support
15056,Bravo!!! courses app is terrific.
15057,"I really like coursera, but the app lacks some major features which the web version has: more control over video. First, the app version does not have in-video quizzes; second, there is no way to make the video faster or slower."
15058,A very useful app!
15059,If you let me acess discussion forum through app i will give 5 stars
15060,Speechless
15061,Invaluable!
15062,I love it
15063,Knowledge for freee...!
15064,I totally love this app and more over what it stands for. Excellent and my favorite app.
15065,It's  Amazing! It just lacks some classes that I want to attend to
15066,It started off okay then it crashed and wouLD not start again
15067,Only reason I've ever used the app was to cast it to the chromecast.
15068,The most great initiative that I ever have possibility take part in.
15069,Please fix
15070,"This app allows me easy access to my courses, but there are some issues.  The links within the app do not seem to work.  If not for that, I'd give it a 5."
15071,It is the best learning app i have ever used
15072,I still encountered some problem espescially with 3g connection
15073,I love this app
15074,"Pity, but Coursera ends unexpectedly on MediaPad when opening any of my courses, or trying to open course description from the catalogue"
15075,Gud app
15076,It's not convenient to use anymore.  What an unfortunate usability hapering decision.
15077,Great courses always in your hand!!!
15078,It will be nice
15079,Everyone should have this app.we can learn alot in many fields
15080,Why remove Chromecast? Bizarre. I've stopped using this app as its just no longer convenient.
15081,"Need support: the level of volume is small, no avatar and the color of subtitles."
15082,Coursera is wonderful but lack of saving videos to sd card is really a bug problem. Videos need really big space.
15083,Feature regression is not good
15084,Finally a great place to learn more and more
15085,This is one of the coolest things in education right now!
15086,This is awesome !!
15087,Loved it.
15088,"Love the app, and I love coursera. Keep up the good work"
15089,I already took a class on coursera and it was a great experience. Taking my next class this March. Great app.
15090,Everyone must have this
15091,"Continuously get a network error,  unable to join any class"
15092,Can't set the speed of the videos
15093,The app seems to work ok online. I used option to download/cache the videos to my device so I could use it on the subway where I don't have an internet connection. The app demands an internet connection to even go into the section to watch the videos I saved. Major app FAIL since it cannot be used offline for practical purposes with no internet. I'll have to go to the web site and get videos manually.
15094,I love this app!
15095,Sometimes able to cause hard reboot... Not sure how that is possible.
15096,You will find almost everything in this app regarding the courses on coursera. I wish you could download videos also.
15097,"except the videos wont play, download or direct on my Sony... Then whats the use of it at all.. . Ill be using it directly from the web for now.. Pls fix whatever the prob is cuz not many user has this prob.."
15098,Miss playback speed setting. Sometimes screen can be turned off only to listen to the video. Would really like an option to download videos to SD card (my phone memory is quite small).
15099,Nice medium
15100,Tremendous stuff from top universities...
15101,Love learning new things!
15102,It would be better if I could watch courses that have no openings yet.
15103,I'm really happy for join this course. This app help me so much to learn more things. Thanks coursera
15104,Join and share in the top corner never worked on my Samsung S3
15105,"Within a course, ordering and organization from the website is lost, so you get a mixed up list of entries. The course intro page isn't even displayed."
15106,Awesumeee
15107,No option for preview course material. Please add this option.
15108,Yeah!!
15109,One can learn a lot from the courses Coursera has to offer...
15110,Best app for learning
15111,This is one of the best learning network I have come across. Keep it up coursera. The world needs you.
15112,Ok
15113,ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤ ÿÆÿßŸÑÿµ
15114,Best app
15115,Great learning source
15116,Amazing way of learning
15117,The app is very slow..to use..
15118,Great resources for information.
15119,"Not able to join any course through the app - get network connection error even though the internet is working properly. Also, the app speed is very slow."
15120,Unable to find lectures for the course I have registered. Its just showing the introduction video of the course.
15121,"Everything about this app makes is much easier to learn without the extensive paperwork or required work. And the new Chromecast feature just nails it for me! The only thing missing, is obviously SD card support. EDIT: No longer works on my tablet, my course won't load, searches are always empty, and crashes all the time now, worthless now. AND no more Chromecast!? This is pathetic."
15122,No more Chromecast support?!
15123,I found love: Philosophy and the Sciences by University or Edinburgh. Sweet.
15124,Very good for all students.
15125,Can't join any of the courses via the app. It's really only useful for searching.
15126,Need a speed-up button!
15127,Great
15128,Why can't we download old courses?
15129,The app doesn't have forums which is highly disappointing. Further in video questions are also missing.
15130,"Installed coursera 2 weeks ago but haven't used it or created the required sign in. Yet my phone tells me that this app is in the top 3 to 5 of mobile data usage, using more than Facebook. Care to explain? Meanwhile, uninstalling."
15131,The content provided is no less than the web application
15132,This is the best online educational app. Absolutely brilliant
15133,"Coursera is by far the best self learning tool anyone can need. Very broad selection of courses, very good teachers, different perspectives from teachers all around US and Europe. And it's chromecast compatibility, makes it the perfect tool."
15134,"It used to show up, now it doesn't."
15135,My downloads needs to be organized by course. Offline needs improvement.
15136,The videos don't work which video player should i have? To be aware my cell phone is samsung galaxy star plus
15137,"It helps me a lot make my dream come true learning from distance in a great school world wide , thanks coursera"
15138,Innovative
15139,I can't see any videos from coursera with my galaxy tab. Constantly it says Can't play video
15140,The website is definitely better.
15141,I really apriciate a service like this with broad topics and choices. Thank you for the good work.
15142,Awesome
15143,"Can't view or do the ""do at your own pace"" courses. This app still needs developing."
15144,Video can't be stored on external storage... Basically makes app useless...
15145,I wish EdX follows Coursera and launches its Android app.
15146,Its A Virtual University
15147,For old version
15148,On line  short  course. ..
15149,Please work on the download. It's difficult to download from mobile. I have to use my pc before I can download.
15150,Very useful
15151,I loveeeeee studying
15152,"Clean, neat, crisp and clear. Great job. Highly recommend."
15153,I updated. And it stopped working. moto G first gen.
15154,"A supposedly helpful review by g+ user ""Jo Friday"" appears to be a misunderstanding of this app or a misplacement of his/her review. Moderation needed?"
15155,Very buggy.
15156,Has improved my career and demystified many improve on video downloading needs improvement
15157,I have learnt a lot thanks to coursera
15158,Crashes constantly after the update !
15159,"Unknown error code ""-24"" during installation.  Doesn't install.  Please leave response and I'll try to re-install - thanks"
15160,Liked the feature of pick up where left
15161,"I really like coursera and its offerings; I've taken several courses. I've tried using the app a few times and each time I've gotten too impatient and switched to the website so I could speed up playback, which allows me to greatly speed up learning and keeps me at better attention. Please integrate this feature."
15162,It is unfortunate if Coursera no longer works with Chromecast.
15163,Yak
15164,Thanks
15165,"The first business I searched for, the app gives me a bunch of locations, miles away, elsewhere.  Yet it doesn't include the location 5 minutes from me.  The second business I searched for, is no longer open, yet the app shows it open, complete w/address & phone#.  Because I know my area, it's no problem. For someone new in town, this could be very aggravating.  Going back to using Google search.  Uninstalling."
15166,Good
15167,I use their website more. The app I use on emergency occasions.
15168,Without Chromecast there's no advantage over the website.
15169,I learnt a lot for free. Thanks lectures.
15170,"I would like to have a more functional offline mode, be able to launch the app, and better quizzes management when the app lost connection,... Otherwise it's very helpful to have this app."
15171,Waited for ever for the official app!! Yes. It's going to be soo helpful! :)
15172,Good
15173,"can't verify assignment, keeps force closing on quizzes"
15174,Ramp your skills...
15175,Him nice
15176,App is lousy.
15177,Very unstable
15178,isn't it working with Chromecast?
15179,"Lets you download video lectures, but doesn't work offline. Not as featurefull as the old 3rd party apps. Particularly missing are the ability to access downloaded videos, and continue playing audio while the screen is off."
15180,Its the era of practicing new learning and much diversified education.
15181,Can you please add ability to speed up and slow down rate of video feeds? Do that and I'll give 5 stars.
15182,Awesome!
15183,Add courses for auto cad
15184,"After one week of not using it I checked what programs were using the most data. I was shocked to see it at the TOP of the list, having 111MB of my data and I'm not even enrolled in any Courses currently!!!"
15185,Please add this app in windows store
15186,Why download videos to some remote place that cannot be accessed without root and renaming those files to make it worse. I don't believe you guys have problem with people saving those videos as per there needs.Change it if possible... Uninstalling...for now....
15187,"When I search for a course, it says no result, then kicks me out of the app because ""Coursera has stopped working"". Please fix this."
15188,Please give different speed settings for videos like in website
15189,Useful
15190,Coursera is on the list of supported apps for chromecast but I don't see the option to cast.
15191,Easy and convenient to use. Please include the slides.
15192,Please add this option to help keep big data amounts and a few courses.
15193,I have learned a lot from courses since last year.
15194,It will be better if there is an option to save videos to SD card.
15195,I cannot play the videos on Chromecast anymore :( Nexus 4 Android 5.0 here
15196,Good
15197,"After uninstalling and installing again after updating Android O.S., I forgot my password. Coursera has no option to retrieve a lost password and refuses to create a new account under the same e-mail address. Ultimately, now I can't even enter the app."
15198,Please fix chrome at support in latest version. It's the entire reason I use the app.
15199,"I love being able to travel and watch my videos, but you cannot access the class section screen, even to watch videos, when offline. You only get a linear list of ALL videos from ALL classes in a single list. Please keep improving offline support!"
15200,Has been a use full tool
15201,I  doing my best to support any educational activity for free
15202,Perfect for me
15203,"Works really well, downloads content for offline viewing. Loved it!"
15204,"I was having issues seeing some lectures on my phone, so I went and got a Chromecast dongle just for this. Now I see there's no support the first time I got a chance to try it?  Wow. Uninstalling with extreme prejudice."
15205,Love it
15206,I can learn whatever I love.
15207,Pretty pointless if video won't play.
15208,ÿπÿßŸÑ€å
15209,"However, I miss the ability to run videos at faster speeds which the video player in the browser can do."
15210,"Finally , in this world , we have some people who are caring bout others ! :') I'm very proud . Thanks"
15211,Education at your doorstep
15212,"Guys great app... Just fix the certification option for signature track, when I press ""verify"" the app crashes...?!"
15213,It simply does not work. A mess. There was a coursera companion app which was awesome. I think they should have killed it by a law suit or something as that one is not working either and is not available in play store anymore. I hope they know what they are doing.
15214,The update took away the only useful feature which is chrome cast. Useless pos now.
15215,Chromecast is one of the best features of this app .... Please chk this issue
15216,What's the point of having the apps if I can't watch the videos
15217,good
15218,Nice
15219,Does the job. I used to like Coursera Companion more before it ceised to exist.
15220,Chromecast missing
15221,"Great app, but there are a number of features missing from the web app. Playback speed adjustment would be really nice!"
15222,Works well
15223,Good
15224,"A very good app for learners, with smooth flow between your past and present courses."
15225,Still at the level of watching videos
15226,Best courses here.
15227,Really like this application. But it's missing or lacks access to the discussion forums which are significant part to the online learning experience.
15228,Most useful app
15229,Luv it
15230,"Getting some ""retrofit"" error when doing almost anything."
15231,"The app doesn't do much, it's too basic and lacking in features compared to the web version. Also it would be nice to have Google sign up as I always forget the password for these things, I can't remember login details for each and every service I use. It's not 2004 anymore, this problem has a solution."
15232,A fairly useless and redundant  app with out Chromecast support.
15233,Best place to get knowledge.
15234,Loved it..
15235,Thanx
15236,"O programa eh bom, mas de vez em quando trava no meu celular. Toda vez na hora de reabrir ele encerra e tenho que abrir novamente. De qualquer forma, o material do Coursera eh otimo."
15237,University on the go
15238,"No chromecast support,  can't register for classes,  can't see classes I am in. Please fix it asap."
15239,Great way to learn!
15240,Latest android version is getting better.   It still really needs the variable playback rate available.
15241,All this free info? You can do whatever you want in life.
15242,This really helps me a lot
15243,"Video doesn't load on app(even with 3g connection),and even after downloading,video is taking 1-2 mins to play."
15244,Best in class
15245,thanks for making this handy-app.. it helps me to finish my 3'rd week quiz.. but I can't verify my submission (I'm on signature track). always crashes. please fix this issue.. thanks
15246,ugly
15247,"Things have been fixed, fast, THANKXXXX"
15248,Wow........
15249,Its wonderful but they nerd yo improvise the quality for slow net with exact same features to be provided.
15250,Watch videos? Check. Answer quizzes and other homework/evaluation? Not yet. It would be great if it were possible.
15251,Amazing highly professional educational platform
15252,Bring back chromecast support!
15253,At home I would love to be able to stream lectures to my Chromecast connected video setup.
15254,"It's a pity that there's no more chromecast support.  And the ""on demand"" classes don't seem available. Other than that great app"
15255,Amazing stuff guys...keep it up
15256,Cousera is an awesome website but the app is not good enough e.g. every time when I restart the app I have to watch it from the start but not where I've watched last time.
15257,Good
15258,Great opportunity to student to get world class and up to date learning experience with crucial topic which eventually make us able to be corporate ready candidate
15259,"There are bugs every now and again in the app, but Coursera's people update regularly.  Wonderful program that keeps getting better!"
15260,Just good
15261,Wish if we could complete the courses offline:-)
15262,Can't enter the tests. The pages of tests are empty
15263,"The all caps are because I absolutely love everything about the app, but need the chromecast integration really badly. Help!"
15264,Learning became easier than I could imagine. Anytime and anywhere I can watch my courses on my handset. Thank you so much.
15265,Please do consider adding an option to move the app to the SD card or specify the download folder
15266,"Hi coursera, would youn mind to give us an option to choose where to save directory, my internal memory could not save enough, so i want to add it in external memory without do any rooting things"
15267,"If you're taking Coursera courses, this app allows you to listen to video lectures and even take exams regardless of your physical location. Unfortunately, the app crashes a lot on my Nexus 5..."
15268,It says it is unable to play videos... Also there is no option to download the videos to sd card...
15269,"Can't enroll in classes for some reason, it errors out on me. Also can't view previously taken classes for some reason. Also, Chromecast support is dead? Why?"
15270,Good...i like it...bt very slow....
15271,Why did they removed  Chromecast  support in latest version... without it app is only ok... chromecast is must have feature for such kind of app.
15272,Five stars for previous versions but I am missing Chromecast support in the latest update too.
15273,After the latest update videos won't play anymore
15274,"Why can't I download ""on-demand"" lectures from the app; why does the app insist on an online check with poor reception, blocking access to my already downloaded material; why can't I resume a video from where I left off. Always have to start over"
15275,"I never had a complaint about this app. But after the last update, it appears to be a lot faster that usual. That great. Thanks Coursera!"
15276,where is the forgot password option!!
15277,Nice platform for learning excellent one
15278,I love this .I can easily take what ever type course I want for free. This is so amazing and liget.
15279,The one thing that would be helpful would be to be able to save or move downloaded content to the external SD card as space is now running low and I generally need to watch the video content on the way to and from work.
15280,Please enable roku streaming on this! It's just like chromecast but I heard it's even better!
15281,Easy way to learn something new
15282,"I can't view my current or past courses. The app used to work, but not anymore."
15283,Thanks for helping me in studying and researching
15284,I downloaded video lectures but unable to see videos..only able to hear voice..highly disappointed.
15285,Best app
15286,excellent app to study my courses on-the-go!
15287,Thats too good app
15288,Didn't have things i needed
15289,Extremely helpful
15290,Enable it and I'll participate again.
15291,Helps me a lot
15292,Wish there was a way to alert when upcoming classes you are interested in are open for enrollment.
15293,Great study companion on the go.
15294,The app is most useful with Chromecast.
15295,It shouldn't have option to leave course
15296,Need the capacity to access course dashboard
15297,"I am really disappointed of missing chromecast. It is really essential for me and I see that this is the same for many users. I will really appreciate if you restore it. I would like it even in a beta mode without guarantee for smooth play. If it is not possible because of your policy I would be glad to install the old version of the application, if it is possible, because chromecast casting mostly made me to use this application. However I will give 3 stars because I like Coursera as well as your mobile support. The last 2 stars I keep for the chromecast feature."
15298,Great app but the new update seems to have lost Chromecast! Please bring it back.
15299,A great way to learn.  Thanks Coursera :D
15300,I like it
15301,"Please re-enable the chromecast supoort, it's  vital for a whole lot of people. Thanks."
15302,Nice
15303,"It just needs ability to bookmark upcoming courses. And maybe notifications. I agree that connection with Chromecast could be very useful. Anyway, good one! üòä"
15304,Nice app
15305,My registered courses are not shown on the My Courses section of the app. Pretty frustrating.
15306,Good
15307,I cannot play the videos on my Sony xperia j.Someone help me!
15308,A great way to learn. Access to what was previously unavailable without spending time and money.
15309,Great update! Keep doing it!
15310,A must have app
15311,good
15312,"In the option for my courses,can only see present and past courses. Earlier version showed all three options. Future courses interest me more than my past attempts. Will be happy to downgrade to the earlier version."
15313,Excellent app and wapsite
15314,"While watching the lesson, we can't do the quizzes."
15315,Altre App non ufficiali offrono diverse opzioni che al momento non sono supportate nella versione ufficiale
15316,"missing 1 star for lack of SD support, another star for other options (integration with calendar, chromecast, access forum etc)"
15317,Great app but I wish I could be able to Access my signature track & do my assessments through this app
15318,Perfect functionality. Although crashes sometimes.
15319,No Chromecast support after last uptade. Hope you fix it soon.
15320,"Not sure what updates have gone in. When I launch the app, the landing page is blank"
15321,Not upgrading unless you remove these intrusive permissions. Will uninstall completely if not remedied soon.
15322,Logging requests
15323,why do you need these invasive permissions people?
15324,Great app but needs to bring back Chromecast
15325,"Why on earth would the new  version require access to my phone and phone calls, including knowing who I'm remotely connected to? That's creepy and disturbing."
15326,Please bring back Chromecast!
15327,)
15328,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with others here. The Coursera service is good, but this app has severe permission creep and has lost a significant feature in its lack of Chromecast support. Uninstalling on all my devices. (It also force closes on my Nexus 10.)"
15329,Without Chromecast support this app is an instant uninstall.
15330,Works really well and easy too navigate through.
15331,Fantastic app
15332,"I loved using Coursera with the Coursera Companion app, which had so many more features than this one, but since the official app was released for Android, the developer withdrew Companion, and I'm left lamenting the loss of access to forums and peer assessment, the ability to save lectures to a chosen location and the deadlines automatically appearing in my calendar.  What this app does, it does fairly well, but by comparison, it's lacking."
15333,Too tired of data collection for sale to who knows who. Buhbye.
15334,Why does this app need to take pictures and capture video?
15335,Wonderful site where you can start learning anything else
15336,Can download videos and watch it on the bus/train. THANK YOU
15337,Where's Chromecast?!
15338,"Love it, use it extensively. Would like to see video speed control (1.25x, 1.5x), download of lecture presentations, only voice lecture"
15339,"Like the others, wondering where Chromecast support went."
15340,ÿ®ÿ∑ÿ∑ŸÑ .. ŸÖŸÜÿ∏ŸÖ ÿßŸÉÿ´ÿ± ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàŸÇÿπ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿßÿ≥Ÿä
15341,There is no more chromecast support after the latest update.
15342,"Do not update to 1.4 until they explain why they want to run the app at startup, in the background, and especially why they want total access to your camera and microphone!"
15343,App can turn on and record your audio anytime it wants
15344,Why do you need camera permission?
15345,U can download the course video also
15346,A very good courses app
15347,"The app is great for browsing courses and viewing material, however, for assignments and courses you pay for more support is needed. I don't have a PC anymore..."
15348,The videos is not working well.there's no pic
15349,"i cant download and it is not smooth online, though it is so useful."
15350,Loving it
15351,"Until latest update there was chromecast support and that was neat and useful and working great.  Now,  it appears to be gone.  I hope it is a temporary error and will be added back soon. With chromecast it's 5*. Without,  not so much."
15352,Hallo .
15353,Very easy to use.
15354,Supports chrome cast!! Awesome
15355,Elevate you're mind with coursera.
15356,This app is a must to enhance your knowledge. Offline viewing is really awesome feature.
15357,Its a good app. I don't know about other phones but I'm unable to move it to SD card. If that is solved then 5 star.
15358,This apps is very useful for students. This is great congratulation. Enjoy :-)
15359,My multi talented tutor
15360,"Wish I could adjust the playback speed on the videos, like I can on the website."
15361,"I have been using coursera on the computer with no problem. The app is convenient, or so I thought. I've signed in and tried to add several classes and it won't let me. An error code pops up. I've also tried signing in to classes I've signed up for on the computer and they don't show up in the app. Very disappointed."
15362,"This works fine for playing videos. Gets very flaky when offline, sometimes won't load vids already downloaded. Doesn't show mid-video quizzes."
15363,I love it
15364,I would like to be able tout change the  speed of the video like on the website... Some teachers are so slow to get to the point!
15365,"The app provides access to videos, but thats about it. It doesn't have playback speed control, and you can't lecture notes."
15366,"Awesome, quite helpful..."
15367,5 star content with 1 star execution.  Could not use app to stream or download certain sections of classes.
15368,Love it
15369,It's help me in studying
15370,I've benefited a lot from Coursera without spending one cent. I backup the incentive of giving all beings access to free and good quality teaching.
15371,It's nice to be able to watch lecture videos on the go (when the app works) but you can't take take certificate track quizzes or see what videos you you already watched on the computer. It just feels like a huge step down from the regular website.
15372,Awesome!
15373,:-)
15374,But I cant find some courses available on the site in this app!
15375,It is great! Love it!
15376,Too many bugs with sessions that doesn't allow me to complete quizzes. This app doesn't represent how coursera is great
15377,"The video player crashes every time it goes into background, and it doesn't remember my place or rewind properly. I can't view lab details or instructions or access the forums. I like that I can download videos for offline viewing and as long as I'm online I can take quizzes and read the class descriptions. Still needs work. What happened to coursera on the go?"
15378,I am a big fan of Coursera and the android app is really good. You can download videos and watch it offline at your convenience..
15379,Phycologists
15380,Every time you leave the app and come back to it after a while it crashes. Has been happening for a long time and still no fix.
15381,"Reading notes or slides are unavailable for download, course updates, forum, homework assignment either."
15382,"Good application, helps  me to understand very new concepts easily, But some videos don' t play!.. shows an error?"
15383,Performance
15384,Learning
15385,.....keeps me updated.... home study.... a really great app for anyone who is determined!
15386,"It's very handy having this app available so that I can watch my course videos on the bus.  The only drawback is not having the review questions in the videos like on the website, but other than that, this app is very convenient."
15387,I would like to see video speed options and a richer web viewer
15388,An app for every learner
15389,good
15390,Great app to stay sharp!
15391,Perfect for knowing
15392,Helps me to keep up with the courses I've enrolled to.
15393,I enjoy cooking healthy meals with my daughter.
15394,"Good content, no glitches on Galaxy tab 10.1 end it' s really free."
15395,"It would be nice to be able to control the speed of the lecture videos, like how we can in a desktop browser. Some professors are great but talk just a bit too slowly."
15396,The most resourceful eLearning app yet!
15397,"Though I love Coursera, this is a really pathetic excuse for an app. Lacking multiple features of the site, and occasionally frustrating to use. Don't bother using this."
15398,"I get tired of seeing an error message saying ""Looks like you are not signed up for this course"" and having to login on the webpage it loads just to see my course content."
15399,It's full of bugs. Crashes usually. If I pause a video it freezes and the give me an error every time I try to play it again. There's no access top the forums nor most of the sections. I'm very disappointed with this app
15400,"*No courses about rock mechanics/geomechanics **imagine I found interested course with ""coming soon"" status, how can I add it to my ""lib"" so that to not forget about it?"
15401,Continue learning.
15402,"OK for watching videos, but that's it.  In-video quizzes very buggy."
15403,Lovely app
15404,Great app to keep up with the amazing learning experience from Coursera.
15405,I just bought a new nexus 9 and the Coursera app is my favorite! Hopefully there will be a dedicated tablet version some time in the future :)
15406,Can study anythin...gud app
15407,"This is the only app which does not need to tell me to go rate it. This is an incredible idea and app, so grateful"
15408,Education is no longer a privilege. It's like God to developing countries around the globe. Great!
15409,Just the only one that fully works on mobile. All resources are here.
15410,It is really motivational..I am so happy with the whole idea abt coursera..it refreshes me..Thank You MOOC...
15411,Love it
15412,Keeps crashing on my phantom especially after pausing and taking video back.
15413,"It would be Nice if you could subscribe tot courses which are coming soon, so that you get a notification or email when that course is released. Put that in the app and you have 5 stars"
15414,Great app just what I needed
15415,N|N TRENT REZNOR WOW!
15416,Amazing!
15417,"Needs calender , alarm , more classification,and to allow you set the time you want to search for courses in"
15418,Such a magnificent effort..
15419,A must have for book-worms
15420,Knowledge is the best thing that any human can ask for.
15421,Neat.
15422,It is very helpful to learn new courses that you even haven't ever heard about....
15423,Excellent way to spread knowledge
15424,"Videos are the heaviest files you may download on the phone and I cannot believe this app (or the downloaded videos) cannot be moved to the sd card. Do you if an easy  get around exists, without hacking the os? Thanks!"
15425,The app  seems to be promising....
15426,"I've tried to login multiple times and it keeps telling me that my password or email is wrong when it's not. My phone is fine, your app not so much. Please fix and I'll give 5 stars."
15427,But now you can't even browse the courses without signing in...
15428,Tons of courses to choose from
15429,"1) Downloads page doesn't categorize videos by course. How can I identify the introduction video of course A from introduction video of course B? Also 2)  Old already-answered in-video quizzes keep popping up for no reason at random times (android 4.4.2, Coursera 1.2.2 (879) and Galaxy note 8 inch GTN 5100) Finally 3) There should be a feedback page."
15430,Good for teaching things to my kids
15431,"I love the concept and the selection of courses on offer. Though, there are major functionality issues for my lg optimus l5. I cannot load any videos, download or stream, and i cannot solve the problems because the drop down boxes i select just stay selected and not display any information. Fix these problems and i will give the app a 5 rating with an outstanding review."
15432,Free online courses from top-notch Universities....can't ask for more :-)
15433,I feel like I've new adventures to go through
15434,But it should have ability to be installed to sd card. Or at least configurable download folder
15435,So Brilliant
15436,A very well written App. With some improvements it would be perfect.
15437,Dildil
15438,"Works well, but absolutely NEEDS an option to move the downloaded videos to the sdcard. A couple classes at 3 hours of video a week each, of course all in the least compressed format possible, and I'm eating ask my internal storage."
15439,"I especially like the feature that allows you to download the lectures to watch offline. It seems to lock up when I work on the quizzes, so I still need a PC to compete the work."
15440,Self educated
15441,Glad to coursera app. Would like to see settings to change video download location (SD card etc.)
15442,Nice
15443,Please provide the ability to change playback speed and unlock access to downloaded videos.
15444,Love you long time Coursera
15445,Super
15446,A really nice one
15447,Need ability to post on forums
15448,Very informative and benefitial
15449,Great for me
15450,Crashes after being minimized on my Phillips w823 if playing lecture. Also lack of access to forums.
15451,"This is far beyond basic. You will not be able to view nor do a quiz, can't view nor complete assignments, can't participate in the forums. If you're doing it just to watch videos and nothing more then it's perfect for you. But anything extra you will have to leave your phone and get to a computer."
15452,Am about testing it.....wish me luckily
15453,"If your like me, then your phone doesn't always load. I feel that there should be full typed documents so u can read them. Besides that, I feel this app is very helpful."
15454,Amazing tool to learn on mobile but they should cover some more topics related to medical field.
15455,I can't see the videos.  Only the voice.
15456,"Videos stream seamlessly and I prefer app to browser for watching course videos and taking quizzes, because of the wonderful and user friendly UI"
15457,one of the most amazing apps ever thank you for making learner so much easier :)
15458,Great
15459,"I've already taken several quizzes and I have never been successful in submitting it through the app! I ended up redoing all the questions and submitting it using my laptop. Also, please include the forums in the app version. Notwithstanding these glitches, I really love Coursera. Downloading the lectures through the app saves me a lot of time. It just consumes a lot of my phone memory though so I have to delete other videos as soon as I finished watching them."
15460,Brilliant
15461,Excellent website and app .. thanks coursera.
15462,This app has allowed me to attend courses by Wharton.  Valuable
15463,Fantastic course  content free too. Very helpful  for my professional coursework. Thanks fellas! You are life savers
15464,Great App for Education
15465,"I love Coursera, I entered the world of MOOCs thanks to Coursera, so this app comes in really handy!"
15466,Thanks for fixing subtitles issue
15467,"The app is quite prone to crashing on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. It isn't a fan of multitasking, so when I watch one video, switch to Google Now/a browser to search for something, then come back to the video, the app likes to take pause.  On the positive side, it is possible to download lectures for offline viewing.  On the down side, when accessing quizzes, it is simply the website stuck into the app into a subpar web browser, not optimised for devices other than desktop. There is also no access to the discussion forums. The video player could also be improved, adding features such as change playback speed, and remembering where the video was last stopped, then resuming in the same spot.  As for CourseRA - love it, love all the courses and material that has been made available. The app itself needs a little work."
15468,"One would think that Coursera's mobile applications would be so much more important than their web application: watching & listening to lectures on the go (or out of one's home/office) should be pretty common. However, this application -- while existing -- fails to impress. On a number of occasions it just crashes, which is bad enough. Downloading videos is unreliable and slow. Videos, while being watched, do not keep the screen on, requiring constant tapping. The speed change feature of the web player is absent, despite multiple licenseable third-party video players on Android allowing this. There's no audio-only option, though that seems like it would be pretty useful to devices with limited battery capacity.  In all, this feels like about the minimum product that Coursera could have built to check the ""Android App"" checkbox. It leaves so much to be desired, at the very least in the area of lecture playback."
15469,Black screen on all videos
15470,Priceless
15471,"No more sign up this sign up that before using app, plus I only use google plus or facebook for new sign up requests. Deleted."
15472,But 4* because of Crashing...This app crash several time...anyways all content are really cool
15473,"Crashes virtually everytime I run the app; get a text partway through a video - CRASH! Look something up online - CRASH!! So many videos also don't play, which can result in cumulative disadvantages once you reach the questions stage; even those that do work (with WiFi) DO NOT work without WiFi, even if you download them specifically for offline viewing. Despite these manifold flaws, and others still, it is a beautifully conceived of app and I am proud to be addicted to it."
15474,"User-friendly app, easy to play video lectures, overall a great platform to learn various subjects"
15475,"I love Coursera, and I love that I can use the app to download videos to watch on the go. But this app crashes (twice!) literally every time that I open it. By now, I'm used to it - I just plan on hitting ""don't report this crash"" twice, then launching the app again."
15476,It's help you to build your self and achive to your goals
15477,Doesn't have many courses available. You have to wait for a given time to join course.
15478,Brilliant
15479,It is awesome man. Keep it up.....
15480,Missing cast...
15481,Classy. What I wanted. :)
15482,Good educational apps
15483,Galaxy SII
15484,Now that I started getting into my courses I would have thought and hoped that discussion forums would be in the app. Their absence almost makes the app irrelevant.
15485,"Forums, assignments, additional resources are all missing. Currently it's easy to watch video on the go but that's about it."
15486,"Now every time I open the app, it crashes. Reopening again fixes it. So I need to open the app twice before I can use it"
15487,In phone with limited internal memory we cannot download more videos for offline viewing. When videos are downloaded it fills up my phone internal memory which is 2 gb. I could not find anyway to move this data to sd card or usb storage.
15488,Very very good.tanks manks
15489,"There are a great many courses that are coming soon, I would like to have some way to be either push notifications or email informed when they are starting or able to be enrolled in.  A slight modification that would make a great app much better."
15490,Thank you for making Coursera availabe on Android! Wow!
15491,Useful app but they sell your information. Not happy.
15492,No logical reason why u wudnt have this app ...
15493,"It downloads one video at one time , I have not seen it download all the videos of a week at one time , to fully utilise the network speed"
15494,"Sorry to look a gift horse in the mouth, but 0.) the schedule is a little buried in under 'Course pages', 1.) one should be able to jump from content listed in the schedule to that content, 2.) the video player should retain, a bookmark to the last video content viewed and, and 3.) player speed should be adjustable, the better to accommodate English speakers native and non-, both.    Thanks."
15495,Nice
15496,"It is such a good app and you guys are doing such a great job, giving education for free. Great work thumbs up.:-D"
15497,It's no longer working with my smartphone.
15498,Free Online College classes from top Universities
15499,"do not open readings inside the app, it doesn't work for video and poor for web pages, open them in browser"
15500,"The offline viewing functionality is close to useless. It downloads the videos but the app does not let you see the section with the downloaded videos because ""you have not downloaded this section"". Also, no speed controls on the video player. The content is great, the app is not."
15501,"No app2sd support, no ability to change downloads directory, not even to find download files by any file manager.  Ps. I have android 4.4; changing downloads directory is impractical without root."
15502,None of the courses I've registered for show up in either the past or current or upcoming sections
15503,App works good but it would be nice if they add the option to change the viewing speed of the video lectures. Another thing I hope they add is the option to shut off the screen and still be able to hear the videos.
15504,Downloading issues.videos stop downloading for no reason. great app otherwise
15505,this is agreatest app. i have ever seen
15506,When we download a lecture and leave it without playing it the same lecture cannot be opened in the offline mode.. Please fix this issue..
15507,Great to use
15508,Amazing
15509,"Great app, i liked it from the moment i opened it. however there is a bug everytime i open a video it shows that the application has crushed.please fix it."
15510,Great way to learn stuff outside of your field! Highly recommended!
15511,Where has this been my whole life
15512,Marvellous..... Curious mind will benefit large from it
15513,Very useful and the lectures look great on a Nexus. It'd be great to have an option to change the viewing speed for people like me who enjoy watching their lectures at 1.25x.
15514,"Coursera is an amazing product. If we could mark which videos we have opened/finished, and could organize the courses in order of how they are displayed, it would be perfect"
15515,"I am very unhappy about this app. After this app is released, the good old coursera companion can no longer login (which I already paid for all plugins). And this new app is much much worse than coursera companion! It does not support changing speed, does not support window mode (for Samsung devices), and often black screen (no video, only audio)... Completely broke my work flow and killed others!"
15516,"I love Coursera,and the app is good as is, but easier access to the quizzes and discussion forums would be great. Some courses require participation in the discussion forums, and, if you have limited access to an actual computer, it can make it difficult to gain a statement of accomplishment."
15517,love the machine learning class
15518,The app is pretty nice and simple. However it would be perfect if it had the forums and discussions as well.
15519,"It seems to be impossible to follow links (for instance, to download a supplementary PDF material) :("
15520,This is an amazing idea and equally awesome app
15521,"Easy to use, help me to much. Thanks"
15522,Please add autosync of all deadlines with Google Calendar and speed up videos feature.
15523,Great. Place to learn from great teaching faculty
15524,Constant crashes when switching back to the app after some time. Sometimes Video doesn't start. Offline video doesn't have quizes.
15525,Great it makes commuting fun as I can learn something new everyday day.
15526,"This app is pretty good, but not up to the standard of the third party apps like ""Coursera Companion"" and ""Coursera on the go"" that were available until recently. My key feature: speed controls for lectures. A total must for some lecturers, and really helps optimise my time."
15527,Best for working people to upgrade themselves on the go and get connected with the most recent knowledge.
15528,Awsome
15529,It's a great opportunity for any age student to learn something from simple video lectures in free time.
15530,I keep getting errors when I play the video.
15531,This is the best app I've ever downloaded!!
15532,I tried i learned alot
15533,ÿπÿßŸÑ€å
15534,Decent app but desperately needs a speed up option. Quite useless without it
15535,great app
15536,It would be much better if the video speed could be changed for the mobile app.
15537,"Great app, but it needs the ability to play the video even when the screen is switched off"
15538,Hate that I can't save the videos on my memory card
15539,Would be much more useful if video speed can change
15540,"No more crash on start, saves position, offline download, syncs progress to Coursera."
15541,Fantastic
15542,"I use Coursera daily. I would use it even more if I was able to access the forums via the app. I would even settle for a mobile site, because right now they're unusable on mobile."
15543,Made with lot of thinking . great app . must for educational students
15544,"Take classes on nearly any subject out there, from science to philosophy to history. Easy to use video interface, and now you can even take the quizzes!"
15545,This is very basic.  The in video game quiz feature doesn't work.  There are no video display (example: speed) options.  Coursera should open the source to this and some student in one of their courses would make this reasonable in days.
15546,How can I cache videos in SD? It quickly stuffed my phones memory
15547,I hope it will be useful for me :-D
15548,Could not slowdown the speed of video ?
15549,It's one of the best educational apps I have come across. It's free & it only needs an internet connectivity & our time to study. Great stuff.
15550,Love it but i wish i could Download courses
15551,It was good Hope the App update is better and Coursera is Awesome !!!
15552,What's better than free courses? Free courses on your phone!
15553,I've used the desktop version for so long I can't bear to listen to these in real time please add the speed up option!
15554,All downloads are under /data folder. It is impossible to export videos unless rooted
15555,"I usually play videos at 2x, but this app doesn't let me."
15556,without sd card integration it is not really useful for offline study.
15557,"Surprisingly, I could find nothing of interest. More technical and abstract thinking than hobby related."
15558,The Android version of this course suite is even better (for me) than the PC version. This is excellent course material wonderfully presented.
15559,Good
15560,This app so so helpful for me. I can learn alot
15561,Its not showing subtitles in this version and crushes alot !! Reported from nexus 5
15562,"Please add reminder notification for deadlines for quizes and projects for pertiular courses. It should be like, you can make on/off for notification. You can also set time for remiinder for it like one day before or 4 hours before."
15563,Just finished week one on a five week course on learning techniques about learning. Free classes from State Universities from all over.
15564,I enjoy taking courses for free
15565,I love how they provide all the subjects. This is great for independent study
15566,Learn for free guys...
15567,Love it!
15568,Omg....free learning.  Nomnomnomnom
15569,Has everything you need to learn on the go. Works and feels like your are using the chrome web browser. So glad I downloaded it.
15570,Tried several courses. Work out very well.
15571,Love it
15572,Often crashes at launch after being in background for several hours
15573,Awesome
15574,For smartphones in busy life very nice companion for knowledge updating.. Thank you very much all.
15575,In a word where everything has a price education is shared for free...well done!!!
15576,now you can learn everywhere ;)
15577,ÿ¢ÿ® ÿ®ÿ£ŸÑŸÅ ÿ¢ÿ®
15578,Cannot see subtitle
15579,"Since a few days subtitles don't work anymore, reinstalling didn't help.  Besides decent app."
15580,"With Googlecast support, I can really experience a classroom at home!  With so many classes, this site has a class everyone can use regardless of the field you are studying.  Competing services may have better specialized content, but this Coursera covers far more topics.  Add an app that is quickly changing to meet the needs of it's users, and that is encouraging.   All I can really ask for is the ability to choose a download location."
15581,"Great start, but a far cry from the web equivalent with too many crashes/broken functionality"
15582,"This app refuses to acknowledge my email as real (my domain ends in .codes), and has the login button disabled. This is the same email attached to my account online (where is does let me login)."
15583,It does not work properly with subtitles.
15584,"The app, especially it's download feature, works really well. But it crashes occasionally. Also it should be able to notify about deadlines and and move the downloads to SD card."
15585,Working 6 days a week 12 hours a day leaves little time for luxuries like education. This app has allowed me pursue my interests outside of work. I mostly use it for learning things I think will help my career.
15586,-Needs playback speed like the web version. Instructors speak slowly and for native speakers this can be a real time waster.    -Submit quiz is missing a progress indicator and submission is slow leading to uncertainty if delivered.
15587,"No descriptions and other folders in a course. Only videos and quiz. Switched to web, unfortunately."
15588,"1 word, it's merciless!"
15589,I can't view any quizzes!! What the hell! Why did you guys even release the app
15590,"I'd give 4 stars, but after some updates the video subtitles ceased to display on my phone (Galaxy S2, Android 4.4)"
15591,Can't play videos.
15592,Keep it up
15593,"... If only it supports its subtitles too, it could be amazing  I'm not english natural speaker and I need subtitles, I hope they'll add soon subtitles support."
15594,"Brilliantly built app,very light weight and highly usable. However there is a main issue with it, the app allows the system to sleep while playing videos, this is rather annoying and joy killer when you are watching and listening to a course but I'm sure it is easy to tackle in the coming version."
15595,"The application is a mess. Yes, it exists, it supports Chromecast, these are two stars out of 5. No subtitles via Chromecast, nothing from the original structure of the course, and no integration with Android. For example, when I'm Chromecasting the video and want to pause it from the top menu, there is a pause button, just like any player's button. But if I press it, it gets me to Coursera main screen in a landscape mode, so I have to tap the pause button there. And there so many things like that."
15596,I love the app but can't see the subs even though turning the subs on. Why is that? Does everyone have this problem???
15597,"I would really like to use this app as I am always on the go, sadly videos don't work on Android (Samsung Win) and I had to uninstall"
15598,Thanks you coursera! Wonderful app
15599,Simply awesome
15600,Itunes u is still the best!!!
15601,No option for saving course videos based on course
15602,Please update the app
15603,Wonderful
15604,It will be better that the cousera app downloads it's videos into the /sdcard folders instead of downloading into the /data/data/.. folder. It's comsuming space for apps
15605,Compared to web page has this app limited functionality. Subtitles of video won't load for some reason and in video quizzes do not work as well. That's quite a let down if I imagine how many people uses this app.
15606,"Nice app. I can browse all the courses. Directly play video lessons, one by one"
15607,The app has upgraded from previous version...now can connect course videos and links..but still has scope for further improvement
15608,This app offers something that is worth thousands of dollars for free I am already a great fan of this organization and all the teachers across the globe supporting this wonderful organization. Keep doing this great work and giving people this great gift of learning to more and more people.
15609,Add ability to change video speed & to solve in video quizzes
15610,Love the content. The app needs polishing. Feels like it was hastily designed
15611,Lectures not playing on Xperia E
15612,"This app has such a wide variety of courses, I wish I had more time to take them."
15613,"I was using the far better ""Coursera on the Go"" and I am now frustrated with this one, which: a) is not configurable at all, b) I cannot get it to show english subs c) Is so unorganized"
15614,"1-You don't can move it to the sd card. 2-when you download the lesson it go to your phone and fill your phone, not sd card possibility. 3- don't show the questions that are in the lesson that the online version do.  Very good the chromecast  for saw on TV's."
15615,Thanks for developing the world
15616,This app is very good. One improvement needed is to mark the completed lectures  as 'Watched'. It would be easier to keep track of the progress made.
15617,"On the website, I always speed up the video. Without this feature in the app, I can't use it."
15618,Whenever I tries to play a video it says can't play the video video error.
15619,Not able to play any videos
15620,Good
15621,Need to have the in-video quizzes in the app also. This is causing the app to lose out on a very good and essential feature of the website. Please add it soon. Thanks!
15622,"One simple fix, allow to open links in course pages on chrome, I can't read the bibliography requested on a course from the app."
15623,Wonderful way to educate yourself!
15624,"Good for watching course videos, including downloading them for offline viewing, but that's really it. You can't do quizzes or peer reviews, so it's back to the desktop after you're done with the videos. Surely Coursera, which is charging for signature track courses,  can do better than this!"
15625,Almost as good as Coursera Companion was
15626,nice
15627,Basic functions for now. Plus for chromecast option.. Missing speed control at least on phone. Problems with downloaded lessons when no net.. Videos are forced in landscape orientation instead of showing Fragment of Video on top of the portrait screen with list of lectures/videos under it...
15628,This is what I feel education apps should be like. This can compete with Kahn academy.
15629,"I'm taking a math course on here, and 3 times now I've had to restart a test because ""I wasn't enrolled in the course,"" even though it clearly stated my name in both the top and bottom parts of the test, where the code of honor thing is. The app doesn't log me out, it only says I'm not enrolled, which doesn't make sense because I shouldn't even be able to access the content if I weren't... Other than having to redo everything every now and then, great app so far. It motivates me to do SOMETHING at least (:"
15630,I tried to get several different courses and each one kept trying to load but didn't.  I love the selection but w I uld actually like to learn something.
15631,Can't play any videos in my Huawey
15632,Uninstalled due to limited functionality and general frustration in attempting to access desired course information. Definitely not worth the permissions the app requests.
15633,"I went online and read somewhere that you have 3 weeks to decide if you want to keep the course youre taking and if you decide to keep it, you have to pay between $30 - 100. Is thia true for all courses?"
15634,Sometimes hangs and also quiz submissions have issues.
15635,only sound and subtitles
15636,"Grt app, but downloaded lectures should be saved on SD card and options should b there to search for videos"
15637,"Rated as one of the best apps by Stuff Magazine. A university in your pocket ,download any courses from maths to medicine study  it  ,complete the test and it will enrol you to the next level! Excellent"
15638,Pls keep on improving this nice app
15639,The app seems pretty interesting  but while playing the clip only the audio plays the video doesn't appear..!
15640,Rich
15641,After I review it further I will post my opinion.
15642,The video donot work on my phone .l hear voice only but no picture pls help
15643,Coursera on the Go app knew a lot more.
15644,"1. Often crashing after switching to another app, e.g. dictionary; 2. Homework can not be reviewed after restarting; 3. There's no subtitles view options; 4. Subtitles are obscured when video is paused; 5. You are not allowed to move data to SD card. Common! Video takes a lot of space! Why there's no option to move data? Uninstalled."
15645,Coursera for Android represents a nice concept but it brings some bugs and restrictions compared to iPad or computer versions. They should devote time in order to fix them and improve the app.
15646,Please add feature to move videos to sdcard.
15647,Hi..I love this! Only issue I have is storage location of downloaded video. Hope you can update the app so all downloaded video can be stored on external storage (SD Card)...looking forward to it
15648,Inspire mankind.
15649,Why cant i see my course on chinese for beginners in the app? Is it for web viewing only? I hope you can make a way to put it in the app. I dont use my desktop pc much.
15650,Really nice app
15651,Doesn't let me play any video
15652,No need to login to laptop .
15653,Great app
15654,please make it so that download location can be changed!!! major hindrance
15655,Video not playing
15656,usefull and handy.
15657,Thinking out loud. Do u have homework reminders yet??! :)
15658,It is a very helpful and productive way to spend your leisure time
15659,Main problem is video freezing. Also needs support for SD card storage.
15660,I cant see the video in online as well as offline mode. I can only hear the audio and see the subtitles.kindly look into the issue and rectify it.just joined machine learning course
15661,Great app to easy learn
15662,Lots of bugs. Refuses to open lesson from course menu while I can see all the individual videos in download manager. Download manager doesn't feel like downloading anything midst of the time. Can't specify location etc...
15663,"This app help me follow my courses on coursera easily. However, video data for watching offline take too much storage. It'll be more perfect if video data can move to sdcard, in that way, i have more storage to save video for watching offline."
15664,"I absolutely love the app and courses I have taken.  Even though it already has MANY courses, it could still use more.  Keep up the good work!"
15665,Love it.
15666,Best. Bob in content and app
15667,I love it
15668,Useful to read the courses on the go.
15669,Four * 's. Thanks!
15670,coursera on the go app was better
15671,Awesome!!
15672,Dope
15673,Game changing way to learn new things.
15674,good
15675,Finally on Android! Thank you very much.
15676,Love it
15677,Crashes on startup.
15678,Very useful app
15679,Keep up the work.. ;)
15680,Awesome
15681,Pleasent learning experience
15682,"Muy agradecido, hay un tema que algunas funciones no estan permitidas via movil como foros y algunas tareas, espero lo resuelvan pronto igual vale 5 estrellas :D"
15683,a life changing web app for geeks
15684,How to have the downloaded stuff transferred to sdcard? I want to download videos. But it covers up my internal memory. Help!
15685,Great work
15686,It good
15687,Nice
15688,"You can only watch videos, join or leave courses and see course info.  great integration with chromecast but I can't see subtitles while casting."
15689,"Spoken lectures at normal speed are slower then the brain can handle and it is much nicer to watch them at 1.5 speed or so, but this app doesn't offer that. Otherwise it's fine."
15690,Really wish this app had enabled users to modify the video speed!
15691,"App seems reliable, but doesn't let you adjust the playback speed of videos, which makes many courses very tedious (this was possible in the past, using Coursera on the Go and DicePlayer). Please either add playback speed control, or make it possible to watch videos in an external video player (like DicePlayer or VLC)."
15692,Fantastic app and service. Have been using for months.
15693,It doesn't make sense and when I signed up there was nothing to do.
15694,I hate being forced to use a gmail account.  I don't use a gmail account for anything.  I hate gmail.  Quit trying to force me to use gmail.
15695,"Great website, but this app shouldn't exist in its current unusable state. It doesn't even show the current courses I'm signed up for!"
15696,Even after downloading the videos on a lesson the app doesn't let me switch lessons if I am not online. It claims I have not downloaded the videos... Fix this bug and there are 5 stars from me
15697,The downloaded lectures for offline access are downloaded on internal memory not to sd card leaving no space on my low internal storage. shift the downloaded video to external storage and its 5 star
15698,Beautiful experience
15699,"Videos wont play properly on my Samsung Galaxy.. I can hear the sound and activate subtitles even, but the screen remains black the entire video.. Not happy."
15700,U know what ur helping lot of people I love this app &lt;3
15701,I have learned so much with Coursera.
15702,Can't even monitor discussion forums let alone post to them.
15703,Best app. .
15704,This is a great app but it really needs the ability to filter by language. I want to be able to only show courses presented in English.
15705,"This app is definitely awesome but there is aproblem im facing with this app , Im running out of free space how can I move courses I have downloaded to sdcard. why there is no option to move files to sdcard please make this option available in next update . Thanks for the great effort ."
15706,Very good. I love this App!
15707,Coursera app
15708,I have 1GB internal storage. I could not find way to specify download directory or move whole app to sdcard. Without possibility of downloading videos and limited mobile brandwich it is unusable in my use case.
15709,I tried to login to my account but it's not accepting the password.so when I try to reset the password there's no option for doing that.
15710,It stores video on internal memory which is limited on android phones. They should hire a good programmer
15711,The app clashes now and then. Also it does not shows the peer assessments and related things.
15712,Good courses for android
15713,Can't play video
15714,This app build our learning confidence in study...and make basic concepts very clear and easy. Learning on it is very good experience.
15715,"The editors of this app should add a save to read later kind of option, even if it has to take some sort of memory because sometimes internet is not available. If this option is there will someone guide me to it."
15716,Good quality. No crashes. Works perfectly.
15717,Amazing
15718,"I used this app to complete a course on developing andriod apps, ironically.. Its a great app, very useful for getting course content onto my mobile  but... it would be nice if I could save the videos to my sd card instead of taking up my storage on my device..  That way I could save on my mobile data.  Any chance it could be updated to be movable to the sd card?"
15719,"The platform itself is great for learning new material. However, not every assignment and material for the courses can be accessed via this app. For instance, I cannot access discussion forums and I am unable to neither open a link in an external browser nor can I copy a link and paste it in a browser. I am enjoying the content, but not the functionality of the app."
15720,The idea and the app in general are great and I might take a course on my computer. But the videos in the courses do not work. So that makes it pretty useless.
15721,This app represents everything I hate about flipped classrooms. It is half assed claiming to be a revolution to education.
15722,Please allow changing downloading path. It used up all my space...
15723,Has an almost material design. App did come late to android though. Very late.
15724,"Very interesting, educative n ROUND."
15725,The app crashes when I try to open it from the multitasking menu... Its very annoying... And video downloads stop when minimized
15726,"The app is great, but there is a big problem: the app stores video data only in internal memory which is limited. IMHO, the developers should add a possibility to store data in any SD partition."
15727,I am writing this while downloading this app. Not yet used but i am very happy to get it for android...
15728,"When I try to join classes, I get ""network connection error."" Updates don't help.  :(  but I re-installed twice, it works now."
15729,"In-video quizzes, finally, that's great. But. On my Dell Venue 7 tablet an app cuts off the screen, audio stays streaming. To fix that I'm to lock/unlock the screen. I've tested other video apps -- they are working OK. The second issue is -- and that's really disgusting! -- as I dl all videos from the chapter and I need to go offline, app tells me that I didn't download any videos! Unless that is app bug that is UI issue."
15730,"After downloading videos in the app and disconnecting from the Internet, a couple of times I couldn't access them - no Internet available message appeared.  Once this problem is fixed, I will increase to 5 stars.."
15731,Even better experience than on PC
15732,This app uses lots of storage on my phone (HTC desire) and doesn't have the option to move to SD card.
15733,The user interface looks good . But unable to view downloaded videos . I usually prefer transferring videos into my laptop and watch it . But it is not possible with this app
15734,"The website has ""follow course"" to be informed when a pending course goes live, but the mobile app lacks this-- which would be uber helpful. Thanks!"
15735,Great app but lacks a couple of important features: 1. It should be possible to download videos to ext SD card! 2. Please enable In-video quizzes
15736,Love the education resources I have available to me through this app. No complaints as I understand this allows me to view lectures on the go and then use my pc for assignments and forum use. Well at least for my courses
15737,Ambrosial.
15738,Very good app
15739,wonderful
15740,It's very good try it
15741,"Attempted to look at course documents.  Does not work: ""Error authenticating with Coursera server"""
15742,Excited.
15743,"Main functionality needed: (1) change video speed, (3) discussion forums, (2) grades of quizzes and projects."
15744,"The only thing this app can do is browse courses, register/leave, and view course videos. It allows you to download the videos, but the developers decided to fill up the /data directory with the files instead of a more sane location.  The downloaded videos are inaccessible from outside the appon an unrooted phone. On a rooted phone, all you get is file1,file2,file3... making it useless.  Phone memory is limited, and I can not let this crappy application fill it up. Wait, there's more fun. You have to manually delete the videos you don't need, or yourphone memory is full and unless you know this app has this issue, you'll waste a lot of time trying to find the culprits."
15745,Can't open the lecture slides in pdf or pptx on Nexus 5.
15746,Add some more medical topics plzz...!
15747,super
15748,I recommend this apllication
15749,"All my other apps stream no problem to Chromecast. I don't see the Cast icon anywhere on my phone screen. Using Galaxy S3, Android v4.4.2"
15750,Pkau
15751,Good
15752,"When I try to open any video I receive ""Error(-1, 2147..) during playing video."" ."
15753,Had no problems with the app.
15754,Lecture video is not playing....
15755,It may be made transferable to sd card to avoid occupation of memory due to offline videos.
15756,Nice app
15757,If you haven't downloaded it do it now!
15758,Mantab euy!
15759,I LIKE THIS APP.
15760,Awesome :)
15761,"there is problem with your app, when played in Samsung Glaxy it is only you can listen audio but video screen remains black.  plz fix this problem"
15762,Great app but the video player freezes up my phone. Downloading the videos and playing it does not help either.
15763,I've took a course there learned a lot from video lectures over here. a fantabulous app for those who want to learn in the short period of time in their schedule..I'm looking forward to enroll in other courses as well tnx... For introducing this app to android platform and I wish I could meet Mrs. Barbara Oakley...one day:3
15764,Title
15765,In learning college leveled courses for free and I just started high school
15766,"I just tried the app, had access to all my lecs in 2 different courses, played them and opened an assignment but didn't answer it. Yet, i can use it WITH the website and not totally depend on it."
15767,Super...
15768,Best coures app
15769,"The app provides a great way to interact with the material, more convenient than with the web browser. Video questions should still be implemented and it would be great if the contents/playlist for courses was automatically updated every time (minor issue). Great app, really convenient!"
15770,"So far it seems great. Finally something to help me quench my thirst for knowledge and understanding. But it still needs subtitles in more languages, like Portuguese."
15771,"I just cannot believe that this is free education.  I can use these studies to improve job related skills.  I was a mechanic for many years then came to Peru and injured my spine working alone because my employer feels that a healthy, strong and fifty year old American can do his job alone.  Since I cannot return to mechanics I will have return as a office jock or a teacher so this is a great program to teach me another skill."
15772,Good
15773,Lots of missing functionality within the courses.  Coursera Companion was much better.  Please update the app so it will compliment these great courses!
15774,"Best way to learn anything as your choice. ... very informative, very well way explained."
15775,Taking the latinoamerican course... the android display is wonky. Additionally.. can't open the readings from the app.. did well on the quiz.... but would have learned more with the required reading....
15776,Just about to try the app will revise my rating as I use
15777,I just love Coursera.
15778,To learn too good
15779,Great app need password recovery
15780,Helped me a lot
15781,"Please add a feature to download lecture slides, I need them for quick reference and review later."
15782,It's so convenient to be able to access my courses when away from my computer. App works well. Easy to use.
15783,"I previously gave the Coursera app four stars, because there was (in my view) a serious shortcoming: in-video quizzes did not work. Well, now they do! My only problem with the app now is much more minor: the next video plays automatically, without a way (that I could find) of changing that behavior. Annoying, since that makes the video appear as watched when it actually was not. Also, even more minor, getting back to the list of videos can take quite a lot of taps, but I can live with that..."
15784,Very minimalist UI... Easy to follow... Works seamlessly over both online and offline mode.
15785,"The downloaded video gets stored in internal memory which fills up pretty quickly. Is there a way to store in in external memory? Besides this, everything is cool."
15786,Same insights as the ones below-- I wasn't aware of the peer assignments and other tasks. Did not get a certificate of completion for Leading Strategic Innovation. Boohoooo. üò¢ And I loved that course!
15787,It is really helpful at keeping track if the class I am taking and downloading the lectures is easy.
15788,"So,  android finally gets a coursera app.  After iPhone got one a year or so ago,  then iPad got its own special version,  finally the 80%+ marketshare leader is graced with an app.  Now,  I wouldn't be half as bitter if the app wasn't a cobbled together mess of bugs.    the app frequently crashes.  The videos don't pick up where they left off,  the player is bare bones,  and frequently just stops for no reason.  Quizzes from other videos pop up right in the middle of a course video.  Hopefully fixes coming"
15789,Very useful app.
15790,can you enable screen off? I just wan to listen. tks
15791,"The video doesn't show up! Only the audio is working. I tried their ""help"" button to assist me in fixing this but it just didn't HELP."
15792,Can't do much with this app if I can't login now can I?
15793,I can't wait to get started. I downloaded this app on 3 different platforms.
15794,"The content and the presentation is intuitive and easy to access. The ability to download the video is a great addition. But the problem is Video download is not on sdcard. So, we can't download the videos of great many courses to watch it on the go. It will be better if the video downloads is moved to the sdcard partition.   Thank you!"
15795,"Infelizmente, as legendas n√£o est√£o dispon√≠veis quando sincronizado com o ChromeCast."
15796,"Most valuable use of technology I have seen till date. Best concept delivered in best way by the best faculties to create a better place to live in. Small sizes of videos make not only downloads easy but also concepts short and sweet to understand. And variety of subjects covered. ..at least one for everyone! Methodology....real life scenario, concept delivery and questions, no boring  theories. Thanks a lot for making knowledge accessible and affordable to one and all."
15797,Courses are enriching and concise.
15798,Too good for those who believe in learning
15799,and perfectly executed
15800,Thank you for listening and adding Chromecast support. You guys are the best!
15801,Great  App
15802,Superb app 4 online  course
15803,App is quite good. Add a course on C++ for beginners.
15804,I really appreciate this app
15805,Great easy app
15806,When I downloaded this app it was working well but now I see that no quizzes are been shown . I tried loading it so many times through WiFi n even mobile data.. Fix it ....!!
15807,"Just finished a course using this ap on the road. Missed pass grade due to the app not showing me peer assignments. So missed them out. Also missing all the side bar tabs. Only the course info, videos, and quizzes could be viewed. So 1 star as its mot really fit for purpose."
15808,Good but need to be able to display horizontally and be able to choose player and need to be able to swift left and right for fast forward and back word and need to be able to download videos.  Why don't u just integrate with MX player.  Also need to be able to view past courses which I dddnt register to over the past its VERY ANNOYING I cannot do that.  Need to be able to perform weekly exercise via app.
15809,Great app
15810,"This provides just a small fraction of the functionality of the web site with a limited user interface, it's hard to see any value in the app."
15811,"Great idea, and decent app. It lacks some functionality of the website, and downloaded content can't be saved to SD."
15812,Still need improvement in term of speed.
15813,I haven't opened it yet but hope its good
15814,"It looks like it might have some interesting courses, but there isn't even a category for languages which was the main reason I even looked at the app"
15815,There's this take at your own pace course am in... But it doesn't show up on the app.. Pls fix it guys.
15816,It's been a whole two days and the app is still installing. I tried to do this through my HTC ONE and on my desktop with Google play and still to no avail. I don't know what's going on but this is not off to a great start and my class starts next week! Smh!
15817,Nice design. . Comfortable and easy to watch! !
15818,Excelente
15819,Finally :-)
15820,"They should allow to enter offline entering to course page, when video are already download , rather giving cannot access internet"
15821,Is great for those like to learn more in their life. Alway recommend my friends about this.
15822,I could not load this onto my android mobile phone.
15823,"Can't join any course, everytime I try I get the message ""network error, check your internet connection"". I changed 3 wifi's, and still no go"
15824,Not able to play downloaded videos... only plays as audio. :(
15825,"I really love this app, so now I can study abroad without leaving my country. For next update, please make this app can be move to sd card, because my smartphone storage limited"
15826,Really good app
15827,UI is quite good.
15828,Thank you very much Coursera staff!!
15829,Great to have a coursers app
15830,"The app seems good at first glance, but doesn't allow speeding up videos. I usually view them at twice the normal speed!"
15831,The Coursera app we've all been waiting for! It would be great if the app allowed users to manually select the downloads directory since I'm sure there's still a substantial number of users who rely on an external SD card for storage.
15832,Video is not playing in this app please solve this issue
15833,"This app needs improvements, no discussion forums, some course pages just show welcome. Please fix"
15834,:-D I got my first subscribed class video! It's clear! But I missed some courses before couldn't see them :-( please don't limited them by time.
15835,Very cool apply where we can learn easily and for free
15836,"Coursera is fantastic and this app works really well in bringing the courses to your phone. The navigation is a bit odd - you have to use the back button within the course and not the upper menu.  But the main problem, at least if you have an older phone with a small first partition, is the videos are downloaded to /data so quite quickly you can get an android error message and not be able to update any other apps."
15837,Allows me get access to my course materials on the fly
15838,"Much better on my cell phone, version 1.1.4, Tablet version is later but all I can do is download videos, everything else is blank... aah! I just got this tablet for my courses"
15839,One of the engines of my life.
15840,The ability to download the videos with subtitles and answer the assignments within the app is awesome to get things done on the go.
15841,Real!
15842,Easy way to learn a few new things at a time.
15843,Love this app. I use it daily. Great app.
15844,This app is great a little difficult to navigate at first but found after a short time it is great!!
15845,Some function like background playing should be added
15846,It' just wrapper over web view. Slow and not very user friendly
15847,Great quality
15848,Disappointing. Was looking forward to learning on the go but I couldn't view or download any videos. Let me know when you fix it.
15849,"The only thing you can do with this app is download the lecture videos.. One cannot access discussion forums,cannot complete peer assessments and view the main course page."
15850,Very good
15851,Would've given five stars except it crashes too much
15852,Great courses good app but cant acces the downloaded lectures and dont have much of internal space so kind of restricting me.
15853,"Why do you need to access to my phone ID & calls , anyway great APP"
15854,This is really a great experience of accessing courses through this app.
15855,I hope it is not a sample of software taught in your courses.
15856,"Good App overall. But there are some basic mistakes. The web version of coursera allows students to speed up or slow down play speed, that should be part of this app from the beginning Also, once courser material are downloaded there should be no point to force people to authenticate again (that means internet connection).   Lots of people download because they want to watch  offline. This enforcement is honestly stupid, even there is bureaucracy going on. This makes the download feature unusable"
15857,Great app
15858,"I just hit the install button and a 941 error popped up. I'm using a brand new Nook HD, so there's no good reason for this."
15859,Very useful spp.
15860,Love the app
15861,"I'm taking a history course and there are several segments that I can't watch. I get a message saying ""video error can't play the video"". It's not all segments but i can't make any progress when i can't watch them all chronologically."
15862,Nice app
15863,Please fix it ..
15864,This is best
15865,Nothing well. Course material can't be downloaded. Any written form work not seen
15866,Thanks for your efforts. The chromecast is very nice option as I requested this some time ago.
15867,Great
15868,"Force closes every time I open the app or switch to it. Also sometimes won't play downloaded videos because ""they're not available offline"" when they are."
15869,"Videos crash all the time, very frustrating and can't even get through one video. Please fix!"
15870,Has everything you need if you want to learn for fun
15871,App has advanced user-friendly interface. I just have a lots of fun with it.
15872,videos are not visible.only sound with subtitles can be seen on my Samsung quattro.
15873,Loved it. I can download the videos!
15874,Don't download it
15875,Able to download video lessons and play offline without any issues. Completed my first course and waiting for the result.
15876,Great
15877,Just coursera!
15878,"It's useful to download courses for offline viewing, but on my WiFi tablet I can't view courses even after downloading because I get an error that the course has not been downloaded. Instead I have to look as the list of downloaded videos. In video questions don't work, and as a signature track student I can't take quizzes."
15879,So useful!
15880,Very usefull...
15881,Its been a great source of learning. Though its free but its worth beyond words. Thank you coursera team
15882,Love it. Everything seems accessible. I dont really mind having to go to the websote for quizzes and what-not. So glad I found this site and app. It rocks!!
15883,Please add an option for the download directory.
15884,I use another email address instead of my Google account email. The app should remember the email address that was successful in logging in.
15885,Great for catching up on course lectures. It's missing the important feature of speeding-up/slowing-down the videos.
15886,This app makes taking courses on coursers more fun and far easier. I love it !
15887,Long awaied
15888,I don't care if it crashes sometimes with NPE but can I change where this app stores downloaded lectures? On my phone I don't have much internal memory but I couldn't find how to change it to external storage. And how about in-video quizes? :) Thanks.
15889,This app is really awesome and helpful for studying on the go
15890,"I just wish there were a few courses for Jewellery. I'm a Jewellery designer... If I could learn something about gemstones etc, it would be great"
15891,"Very incomplete, player lacking important features such as video speed, and no possibility to use an external, better player. Connexion errors reset assignment answers. Taking down non official apps to give way for a half-finished, locked down app is not consistent with Coursera's ideal of open education."
15892,"I like that you release an app for android, but forcing to delete the other apps that have been here before is not the way to go."
15893,"I cant see videos ,  when i play some videos only i can able to hear voice but cant see videos.plz fix it. &  i will give it 5 stars"
15894,Good
15895,"i like the simple style,but with the essential function. much convenient downloading benefits me to learn offline."
15896,This company and app is amazing. I am an engineer student and being able to learn various subjects and even other engineering subjects broadens what I can do with what I learned in university by combining them all.
15897,"Whenever I try to join a course I get an error, unauthorised notification at the bottom of the screen and does not allow me join a course via the app"
15898,Perfect
15899,"I love this app. It is top notch and it makes viewing the Coursera course videos extremely easy. This is especially if you enjoy loading all the videos for a given week in one go and watching them piecemeal later.  I wish they would do the same with the course notes, as it seems that this is not currently supported. Great app!"
15900,"Keeps on crashing while opening downloaded videos. If the video player opens, only audio is heard.. nothing is visible on screen. Please fix this"
15901,Awsome
15902,I am presently doing a course on Child Psychology and none of the hyperlinks on the course page work. Also no discussion forum on mobile... That's a serious mishap!!! App needed and is classy but these are creativity problems.
15903,Very helpful
15904,Kindly add preview lectures like desktop version for upcoming courses. Then it will deserve 5 star.
15905,Great.. Thank u
15906,Great
15907,"I find this app easy to use and very convenient. No need to boot my computer. Just run this app and watch lectures, answer quizzes."
15908,"Built-in video player is a joke. Quizzes and homeworks are not available. Coursera requested to remove a fantastic app named ""coursera on the go"" from the store to deploy this less than mediocre app. Shame on them."
15909,One of the best & most useful  application I have on my note 3.
15910,Awesome learning source
15911,Who doesn't love free education!
15912,The previous version of the app could play lecturer voice even if your screen is off. Why on earth should a developer remove this feature?
15913,Loved it
15914,"The app is excellent, however it would be helpful if there was an option to save the downloaded videos to the memory card instead. After downloading a few videos my phone memory is full and I can't move the app or it's data to the memory card."
15915,Great
15916,"Thanks for providing this great app free, I really like this app..."
15917,Simply supb . thanks..

15919,Great UI!
15920,"I am tired of apps requesting permissions that they don't need. Why would you need to know number who is calling me? ""Device ID & call information Allows the app to determine the phone number and device IDs, whether a call is active, and the remote number connected by a call""  "" remote number connected by a call"" WHY? Clean up your code please!"
15921,The fonts are very small and light on my Note 10.1.  There are features on the web page that are not here yet. I have taken Coursera classes and like them but this application is terrible. There is no log in so no dashboard or anything else.
15922,If nothing else take learning how to learn course. Its awesome.
15923,Brilliant app!
15924,"Always gives error(1,9001). Not able to play any video."
15925,Coursera + Chromecast = Win!
15926,"unfortunately on videos there's only sound, not image. Samsung Galaxy Core 2."
15927,"Nice UI, has most of the features I would need, but doesn't allow viewing of slides or course projects or forums."
15928,Great app.Better than the PC version in my opinion.Good job.
15929,The UX is good. It already lets subtitle fetching. The additional feature I need is the ability to control playback speed.
15930,i have been using this app for the past two years and it has been an enriching and fun learning experience! many interesting courses that cater to different interest :)
15931,Love and friendly learning tool
15932,"Pros: I love what they are doing here. Free education with the choice of paying for a verified certificate (assuming you accomplish the course). Learning music recording and now going to try financial taxes course (no idea how to do taxes!) and I am tempted to go for a certificate! You can also download the videos! Cons: I don't think some* courses are that sophisticated compared to lynda. The interface could use some work too. With that said, I'm checking this app DAILY. Love it you guys!"
15933,Great app
15934,Everything is working perfect. Thank you Coursera
15935,"Cousera is an amazing website and the app is very good. I also experienced the sound-only bug on my samsung tab though, and i would really like to see the video speed functionality implemented in this app. This is the main reason why i still prefer to use the web version to view videos."
15936,"thanx, it's so handy. I could easily watch my courses anywhere, anytime :)"
15937,"Love the variety of courses,"
15938,Great
15939,Good
15940,It might be better if there was an actual video instead of just audio I would  of give it a five iif there was a video
15941,Aver que aprendo.
15942,Learning is fun
15943,Very well builded application for all....
15944,Great app. It's nice that invideo quizzes support has been added recently.
15945,Amazing
15946,"The User Interface is very clean but it has some serious issues with video playback. I downloaded the videos for The Data Scientist's Toolbox and it plays only the audio. My phone does not support HD Videos and that could be the issue. So it would be great if we can specify the download format. Also,  subtitles of a previous video overlaps with the current video that is being played. This app is an indispensable tool. Please fix this fast."
15947,Would love to be able to listen faster!! :)
15948,I signed up so fast
15949,There r lot of contents to learn and choose from..great video and sound clarity..
15950,"I like how it handles video downloading, but I really miss speed control. That's the only reason why I use desktop computer for some courses. Support for specialisations would be nice, too."
15951,Coursera makes it easy to stay on track even on the go.
15952,ii
15953,An educated mind is a free mind. Thank you so much for this service.
15954,I do not understand why I cannot download the app
15955,Convenient but video keeps crashing
15956,Good
15957,This is üÜí
15958,Now.. I can study anywhere
15959,I can not move app to SD card. It is consuming all of my main memory. Please fix it
15960,This is really amazing. I love it I don't know what else to say
15961,"Really good learning tools, can use in combination with your CHROMECAST plug-in on the go ANYWHERE there's a TV (w/HDMI port). Any subject you've always wanted to learn they have it. Squandered away college, wished you had gone now. Well now we can. For FREE! Love It!! I'm broke, can't afford college right now. Perfect app for me. Thank You to the creator!Recommending to all my friends and family."
15962,Second start doesn't load videos lectures.
15963,Create app
15964,"Completely functional, but it would be nice to have multi window capabilities for tablets."
15965,Love the rewind feature and I don't seem to have the problems with the app I used to have earlier.
15966,I haven't even yet opened the app but I'm just glad that its here! I will leave a proper review after I've tried using it with my courses. Thanks!!
15967,I found an issue with video in Crafting an Effective Writer. A video isn't reproduced. There is only audio stream. The latest update hasn't fixed the playing error of video. ((
15968,Needs improvement to bring back the adjustable speed feature
15969,Very good
15970,Luke the app especially it's offline lecture viewing mode. Makes for no trouble on the go. There is potential for adding more support for the Signature Track courses to be able to take quizzes and verify via device camera.
15971,Required sign in
15972,"Great app, especially for the video downloads which help on my commute. Any chance you'll include video playback speed change like on the web player? Keep up the great work, I love Coursera!"
15973,The app is just pathetic. I downloaded an intro video of cryptography and the video player plays just the audio.  What's even more worse is that when I turned on the subtitles I got the subtitles for some course on vaccines. Why on earth did you bother to build such an app. Even an android noob can create a better app than this.
15974,The webpage loading was poor and it doesn't load the page sometimes. I had much trouble when accessing the reading using this apps. A fix for this bug would be helpful :)
15975,Coursera's done great work here. Still has some rough edges but it is constantly improving!
15976,Please make video speeds 1.5x and 2x
15977,All featured not added. Still required to access through browser
15978,HTC One X+
15979,Great application..
15980,Due dates should be one of the first and easiest things to find in the app. There should be configurable notifications for due dates.   Loving the Chromecast support! Thank you!
15981,Wonderful music theory course from University of Edinborough. Well organized  and amazingly friendly considering the numbers of students and distances. Teachers/Profs are  professional. I really felt part of a class.  DIfficult material.  This Is not an easy course.
15982,"This app lets you download and save all of the videos for offline viewing -- very handy for when you're killing time without wifi. It doesn't let you do much more than look at content, but that's enough for me."
15983,Better then other apps for coursera. But it crushes time to time I hope the update helps
15984,Great learning experience
15985,A sincere thanks to the developer
15986,The time when colleges go bankrupt.
15987,I want to be able to see and respond in the forums from my smartphone. Can you help me with that? Thanks in advance...
15988,In video quizzes will not submit my answers. I always get an error message. :\ fix that and this is easily a five star app!
15989,Thank you for such a great app. It would be great if there is an ability to speed up/slow down video as it is done in the web application.
15990,"I love being able to have university and college courses to independently study, and the classes are free. The only thing I don't like is that some of the videos don't work and glitch when trying to watch."
15991,Stops playing on the chromecast when the screen goes off. Do try out plex to understand how it's been implemented
15992,"Upd6: Still same error: ""Can't play the video"" (( Whyyyyyy? Why you don't fix it, guys? You can do it, I believe!"
15993,Started getting spam to the unique email I used to sign up.
15994,"I'm using it daily. Latest updates allow for very good features, like subtitles, going automatically to next video, accessing some of the course content, previously available only in the standard- non mobile, desktop like- web browser. Congrats to Coursera!"
15995,Excellent app
15996,"Please fix the app, I can't watch video after update."
15997,It provides easy access to great lectures.
15998,I'm downloading it now! Finally! I've been waiting for something like this!
15999,"The addition of Chromecast support (although a bit flaky sometimes,  at least on my old Lenovo tablet) is nice. If there were support for the discussion forums, then it will be much better (an unofficial app had that IIRC)"
16000,"the courses are easy to find and good to watch, for the UI, awesome, just love it."
16001,"Amazing, spread knowledge all over the world, great idea, great mission, thank you Coursera's staff"
16002,please add move to sd card for video downloads
16003,"As useful and functional as the main site. Amongst the recent features, Chromecast support takes the cake."
16004,The world needs more education apps
16005,Good
16006,Fitting to the remarkable quality approach of Coursera!
16007,"No ability to participate in discussion forum via this app. Download videos, view announcements and attempt quizzes only."
16008,"Good way download lectures for offline viewing. Missing several featues which would make a big difference. Speed of playback is fixed - can't speedup or slow it down, Screen has to be on during playback, which prevents background listening with screen locked or off. No way to take notes while listening. Latest version puts big icons in the way on pause screen, making it hard to read paused slides."
16009,"Please, keep improve the interface. Sort by language, date time and etc."
16010,I can see where I could watch video. I has click on the course but it always show course info instead showing video. Am I right?
16011,Very slick. Saves so much time over the web interface.
16012,Very good course app. With preload vifeo lecture!
16013,Thank you!!
16014,Fantastic app and incredible opportunity for learning on the go!
16015,+1 for the Chromecast support! But it is still buggy on downloaded sessions management.
16016,"It would be nice that the app make everything in the course accessible, e. g.  lecture notes"
16017,You rock!
16018,This update had made it a lot faster.
16019,Great to have Chromecast. Five stars now.
16020,This is a great app. What I would like to see is adding speed control to be able to watch lectures with faster speed.
16021,Nice
16022,Free
16023,"I spend so many hours on the Coursera site, I might as well have it as an app on my phone!  :) Being able to speed videos up would be even more awesome."
16024,Very nicely done
16025,Could have been even better if I could save the videos on external SD card on KitKat. Aren't the videos released under cc license?
16026,Unable to submit quiz or exam via app
16027,Thank you so much....
16028,Thanks for listening devs! You guys rock.
16029,Please add video speed controls
16030,It makes everything easier!!!!!! We don't need to be near a pc to move forward with our courses
16031,I being able to watch my courses on my phone when I'm away from my computer. 10/10
16032,"Thanks, latest update implemented all features I needed."
16033,Very useful
16034,I'm trying to find where the downloaded videos are stored to manage mobile memory.       Not able to locate the backup folder
16035,Great & free
16036,Clogs up space on internal phone storage.
16037,"Video doesn't fit correctly on my screen. Makes it difficult to see certain notes and take certain quizzes. Please have an option to select full screen that fits. Plus, it doesn't seem that I can view any PDF files from lectures."
16038,It's so useful
16039,I love this app! But I wish you can save the courses you want to take that are coming soon. There are many courses I want to take but I have to screen shot it so I remember it . It would be nice if I can put them somewhere when they do have a set date.
16040,Everything is great except the ability to access forums on mobile device. I just love keeping up with the comments :)
16041,"Think its important for this app to spread about as much as possible, hence the 5 star rating."
16042,"Excellent app, excellent service"
16043,I logged out and now i cant log back in! Might be I initally punched in a wrong letter in my password. Help! Its an awesome app though. Thanks.
16044,"Really nice app, quite easy to use."
16045,Increasingly Unstable
16046,Yepiee .awsome stuff
16047,Thank you for developing this great app
16048,"As a strong believer in continued professional development, coursera flawlessly merges affordable learning with cutting-edge tools on an extremely portable platform, synchronized across all devices. The latest Chromecast ability is the cherry on the icing"
16049,Lecture Videos seem to take forever to load... rest all is fine
16050,When I hit submit it then told me that I wasn't signed up for any courses.  Logged back in and completed quiz.  Should check for authentication before presenting quiz questions.
16051,"This is one of my favorite apps, which is why I'm taking the time to provide feedback, hoping to see more improvements in near future:  * At the end of a segment, the video player automatically skips to the next segment. This is an annoyance in most cases, and should be user-configurable.  * Once you click on a segment, it is marked as viewed and there is no way to undo that. When taking multiple courses, it is tedious to figure out your resume point each time, especially when the video player tends to play segments you may not want to watch yet (see above).  * If you hit the back button in middle of a video and then return to the video, it starts over instead of resuming where you left.  * User-interface relies on tiny buttons, which are especially difficult to click on tablets and smartphones. Some examples are the video download button and the new 10-second-rewind button."
16052,Data is stored in phone internal memory
16053,Awsome
16054,you make our lives easier and more enjoyable. Thanks a lot
16055,"Really awsome, excelent content"
16056,can't watch videos!!
16057,Best by champions
16058,"The app crashes, when there is a call."
16059,Useful
16060,Keep learing ....
16061,Really fast development and the app works great.
16062,"Great app definitely a 5 star, but the 1 less star is for the notification. Notifications for course starting and assignments dead line"
16063,"In videos page sound plays ok, but only black screen appears."
16064,Still waiting for playback speed control. Need to use additional software now for this.
16065,Free education!!!! Priceless
16066,The app functions well. The videos don't take long to buffer and it doesn't stop when you rewind it a bit. But the app should have the pop up questions for the video. That feature is still missing. The app should also try and feature quizzes for the non - signature track courses as it's easy to keep up with the weekly course work.
16067,It would be a great to watch videos on my TV vs phone or computer.
16068,First aid
16069,"I took the quiz, but doesn't have options to review. Also download video to sd card is needed. Forms and embedded video quiz is important."
16070,It is great that coursers is on Mobil
16071,Nice work
16072,Even I tried to play a video on my nexus 7. But it's not working. Long way to get 5 star
16073,"Signed up for courses in business and mgmt. It's great and it's FREE.  Almost too good to be true but don't believe me, try it yourself and see..."
16074,The videos are not working
16075,classical app jazak ALLAH o kher....
16076,Great way to learn about your interests for free
16077,"Save lectures for offline viewing is an awesome feature... but some times even though I save lecture video classes.. it some times prompts that there is no offline content available n it never opens that weeks classes offline on my nexus 10, I have to find a hotspot, delete n redownload that classes... it wud be more awesome if we wud have play speed adjustment in the app, that we currently have on the website"
16078,Its really great.  MOOC in mobile.
16079,"I'm using the app on my iPad and everything is great apart form one thing: my current and most important course doesn't load. It's been 4 weeks already, and all I see is an instroduction  by the professor. All other courses work fine. Updating doesn't help."
16080,Before this app I had different one that worked better for me ( now it's not working anymore). Mostly I miss a possibility to save downloaded video-lectures to file specified by me. Now it takes a lots of space on my much smaller internal memory and it's impossible to cast on TV when I want to watch downloaded lecture with my friends. Please fix it.
16081,great for learning
16082,incredible
16083,"After working through a quiz and submitting my answers, the app gave a log in error. I had to do the quiz again on my laptop.  Being able to download lectures to the app is great."
16084,It just doesn't work
16085,Gr8 app
16086,"Hi, I have downloaded the videos of my currently enrolled course. Before the last update, even without internet connection when I clicked on the course it would open videos from my downloaded videos, but now when I click on the course week, it gives error that you do not have internet connection and have not downloaded videos, even though the videos are downloaded on my phone. Going to download manager works, and I am able to see the videos from there.  I am using Moto G.   Please look into the matter and do the needful.  Regards."
16087,awesome
16088,Can't watch videos.
16089,There's no calendar. No way of tracking deadlines within the app. There's no access to exercises from within the app as well.
16090,"However, I miss the discussion forum and the interactive lecture quizzes. Implement this and it's five stars."
16091,Very very good
16092,"I cannot use the app to watch any content. Everytime I click a class, I get a 400 HTTP error. GS4."
16093,love this app but it takes too much device memory the downloaded items are stored in device memory. So please add option to move app to internal storage. Or to set the download path please...
16094,"I see aft of propaganda from a lot of liberal universities.... I.E. climate change (global warming), Evolution /Big bang theory (which is full of holes you can drive a rnac truck through it and not to mention it is a religion). where are the alternatives to these psuedo sciences?"
16095,No option to select where you want the video lectures to get downloaded in your device.  Does it in the internal storage by default. Very important to fix this problem.
16096,Thanks
16097,"Usefull, thanks"
16098,The only reason I don't use this app and instead just go to the website and download the videos is so I can speed them up like I can on the website.
16099,"It is such a great idea, I love it! The only downside is how much of a struggle it is to run the app on my phone. The videos will say that it has pop up quizzes but I can't see them or it will pause to see how you answered on a previous quiz but you can't see that either. Or when you are doing an assignment and it has pop up instructions, they don't fit the screen so you can only see half of it and you can't even zoom in or out or even up or down. There's no way to minimize the screen."
16100,"Would love feature to keep videos playing with screen closed, as well as option to submit assignments in app. Also option to auto download current course materials when on wifi, and reminders to sign up for pending courses (listed as coming soon) when they allow sign-ups. As mentioned in other postings, notifications would be awesome for new material posts as well as finished assignments, and deadline reminders."
16101,A great app for those who want to sharpen their minds.
16102,"Not able to view video on chromecast, please help"
16103,"How about ""forgot ur password?"" Option. I was trying to login, but apparently I already have an account and don't remember my password and there is no way I can get a reminder on my email... Little details that matters..."
16104,"I tried to watch video of lecture. But I have got black screen without any image. There is sound, subtitles, but there is no picture."
16105,
16106,Please add the ability to categorize the downloads by course. Otherwise all the downloads just mix.
16107,Cannot play lecture videos on Galaxy 10.1.
16108,This app needs to let user decide where to download the videos. Otherwise it's just a space hog.
16109,Nice
16110,Need zooming in on lecture videos to read small in-lecture text (urgent for phone sized screens) and playback speed controls.  Or let us choose an external player like coursera companion used to.  Potential for greatness.
16111,There are issues in download functionality. Downloading does not complete in one go. Need to visit multiple times and start downloading. Also there should be option to save on sd card.
16112,Great learning tool! Works flawlessly.
16113,I'm a high school student wondering if these class credits could be used on my transcript?
16114,Please add Chromecast support!
16115,I've had fun and also learned a lot with this app. It is very useful for me. Thank you.
16116,"I use a MotoG and mostly I've found the app to be very useful and smooth. The MotoG doesn't use removable storage, so I don't know if saving location is still an issue.  I only have one suggestion: Please allow me to keep listening when I turn off the screen. Many courses only intermittently require looking at the slides and if I could turn off the screen, I could more easily listen to lectures on the go, which would be terrific!"
16117,This is an amazing application for those people who love learning.
16118,I just downloaded this app. It seems to have some pretty interesting courses. BUT one thing is missing. .. There is no way to link it to my Google Calendar for reminders. .. how do you set a reminder through the app??? Also needs to be able to have a save to SD option. A very simple request for a great app! ! Then I'll give it 5 stars!!
16119,"It worked fine for certain courses, but just began crashing for a lot of other one. Uninstalled."
16120,Nicely Organised
16121,Unable to sign in at all!
16122,I like it so far but I would like it if you could download the transcript
16123,"This would be awesome, but nothing will load on my tablet. The course will come up but not the videos, quizzes , or anything after that."
16124,Course content is awesome.
16125,I love this app. As well as educational video that I can watch anywhere. So I guess I recommend you getting this app especially if you want to learn new and different things in different areas of education.
16126,Videos dont work
16127,Sanctions against Iran?! Preposterous!!!
16128,it's better use web app on tablet
16129,"I've just spent half an hour completing a quiz - and it says ""You are not logged in"". I've logged in, and it is spinning for half an hour. Back button doesn't work. On the web the quiz shows as not complete.  Downloading offline often fails for no reason. And even when downloaded - you first have to get through title like ""Week 1"", and when you click on it, it says ""You are offline"" The videos are hidden somewhere, so you are forced to use a built-in player that does not remember your position and doesn't allow you to change speed. So it is good that Coursera finally has the app, but at this step it is not much more useful than just using the web."
16130,"I am deeply appreciative of the concept behind this application. Free education is a massive massive thing. I must admit though that during a video the app will crash fairly consistently, especially when trying to interact with any of the controls."
16131,"Use the website. It's less stupid. If you don't download the video, it won't resize it to fit your screen. It also won't allow you to pause. So basically you have to download all your videos if  you want to be able to pause  it or just watch it without the need to scroll around on the page. If you try to open up a blank page,  nothing appears. And it won't appear neither."
16132,There is an error while trying to play videos on my Huawei G510.
16133,Very good
16134,When I play a lecture it does not show video I can only listen.
16135,The fascinating lectures with subtitles are fit for beginning learner.
16136,"About the only thing it does properly is play video lectures, although the popup questions dont work. You cant reach any readings it seems. As you get to the page with the link to the reading there is no way to open it. Taping the link does nothing. All in all its a good app if you just need to watch your lectures, but not enough to finish a whole course. Its a poor supplement and no supstitute to a laptop :-\"
16137,Cool
16138,"I'm really enjoyed Coursera content and amazing courses presented. I want to report a few issues with Android mobile application:  1. Videos downloaded for offline access cannot be played - I see error: Error (1, -1004) during playing the video - when trying to play downloaded videos.  This is really annoying as I cannot use your app when I'm offline - and this is important feature for countries where mobile internet is not as good as in US/UK.  2. This is not an issue but rather a suggestion for improvement. When video is downloaded for offline use - it is no longer associated with course and it is not clear which order it should be played.  There was Coursera Companion app on Play market (cannot find it now), they just indicated in normal courses list view which videos are available in offline mode. This is much better then confusing downloads menu item on existing app.  Best regards and keep doing a good job!"
16139,It says I'm not connected to the internet.
16140,Great app with easy navigation.
16141,Save2sd card
16142,Okay
16143,Thanks to coursera ..
16144,"I love Coursera, and this app is incredibly awesome."
16145,This is simply brilliant. I love knowledge and this app is perfect - can I host course on here as well? Please get back to me.
16146,"It is a great effort, but the videos are audio only on my phone, does anyone else have this issue?"
16147,Addict to it
16148,"Generally mobile app is used to keep track of courses and related assignments and quizzes. This app doesn't provide any support to keep track of quizzes or programming assignments. That can help me to remind and complete my work properly. This app should have a ""add to calendar"" feature."
16149,Knowledge is power! So learn more
16150,Appstore
16151,"First of all, coursera app has a 'use coursera app' popup when you open a homework or a test page. It also errors out when you turn off your phone while answering the test questions and then trying to submit the answers... I think it loses connection with the server."
16152,vids  not download
16153,So downloading is almost useless. Add this feature please.
16154,I love this app so much! Thank u!
16155,I love all the online courses offered here
16156,"Does not work at all, this is actually the first one for me. Very disappointed !!!!!!!"
16157,"App is very slow, not loading the contents for a long time.. Don't install this.."
16158,"Really easy to use app for learning. No need to bring laptop, all coursera courses can be accessed from this beautiful app! Really appreciate this innovation"
16159,Free means to develop oneself.
16160,Get it Maow!
16161,The best
16162,This is a great app
16163,"The courses may be great. But unfortunately I can't use the app because the font in Coursera courses is super tiny mini on my tablet. Even if I change the system font to huge, the Coursera font won't change at all."
16164,Pls add courses of equity/stock analysis
16165,"I've downloaded all of videos of week 1 of ML class, when i download videos of week 3, i cant watch week 1 videos again!!!!!"
16166,Awesome
16167,"SD storage is a must, sorry I am a bit disappointed from otherwise great application"
16168,"Occassional errors aside, this app is a must-have for learners on the go!"
16169,Need to know how to drop a class.  FAQs need to be better indexed.  Wonderful idea and I love it. ..but help me drop a class!
16170,Impressive
16171,"The only problem I have is the size of lecture videos. There should be an ability to crop it or watch in full screen mode. Please, fix it. Device: Galaxy S4 i9500"
16172,"When video is playing only thing I can see is black screen and subtitles, I can hear audio too."
16173,"App provides core functionality and has a nice UI, but until video speed options are added, it's not worth using, since I can get through lectures 1.5x faster on the website."
16174,What the hell the downloaded videos are saved in the in internal apps memory! Are you crazy!
16175,Nice
16176,Finally got the Chromecast support!!!!
16177,Can't even watch the videos just shows a loading sign
16178,It is convenient
16179,Please add an auto play function to this application.  With auto play it is much more convenient to listen to classed for people on the road.  It is dangerous for people have to press the next button in order to play next video.
16180,"A handy additional way to access Coursers content; once some of the bugs (advertising the app on in-app web views?) and omissions (no video playback speed control) are fixed, it'll be absolutely essential!"
16181,It's just sad that we didn't have something like this in the 90s.
16182,"Unfortunately I just found out that any quizzes embedded in the video lectures, are not shown when watching lectures in the app... This is really a let down, back to watching in Chrome. Also I would love to add it to the multiple screens options on my Samsung devices so I can take notes while watching.."
16183,I'm glad it's on Android too :)
16184,Best science app
16185,"On my first course I found myself doing the same stuff about three times, not sure if I was missing other stuff and getting confused. Resorted to bookmarking the website in my browser. This worked better."
16186,Great tool to have
16187,Very helpful
16188,Nice
16189,Only problem is being able to access the forums on mobile version..
16190,Would be better if provided options to speed up and slow down the video
16191,Love it more and more‚ô•‚ô°‚ô•
16192,Unbelievable... wish to really learn a lot and really wish to contribute...
16193,"I am doing a course online on my laptop. I downloaded app to do the work when I'm out and about and the apps days ""coming soon""...  -_-  5 stars once it's fixed."
16194,I have been amazed how this experience has been so rewarding and easily available. Tnx gk
16195,I tried many ways to see the videos... I see only black screen with audio.  Please help
16196,It is great. I wish I could post to the discussion forums through the app.
16197,It does what it's supposed to do and works flawlessly on my device. User profile and settings are missing though. Also categorization looks a bit messy. Some courses are listed under several unrelated categories.
16198,Great!!
16199,Very good
16200,Excellent! Thank you!
16201,did not expect it to be so useful. classroom on the go. good job coursera!
16202,"The unique problem is a miss function for per assignment. Without this, everything is fine and better than website."
16203,Works fine ado far
16204,Offers some valuable free courses
16205,"I download a lot of material from this app. Hopefully that I can save them in my SD card. Sadly, there's no feature to do that."
16206,"I can't do the writing assignments through my phone and it's kinda frustrating since I can't be home all the time when I write them. Other than that, it's amazing."
16207,I love it
16208,"Videos aren't playing on my galaxy s3. Otherwise, this would be 4 stars"
16209,Nice app
16210,"It worked for a few days.  Now when I try to play a lecture video an error occurs. error(1,-1004) during playing video Maybe they will fix their application. Samsung Galaxy Note II"
16211,Help. I can't play vids
16212,I really liked it and wouldve given it 5 stars but now it's not working; the error above keeps popping up when I try to watch a video and I've reinstalled it already. Please fix!!
16213,That's the status of every single course I checked (at least a half dozen). DELETED.
16214,Videos do not work...
16215,"ERROR 1,-1004 please fix it ASAP!"
16216,Simple to use..fantastic
16217,"Thought I'd try this app, but couldn't even watch intro for first course. Very disappointed. Galaxy S4"
16218,"""Error (261,-1003) during playing video"" for last days."
16219,I've tried on multiple android devices without success.  A core functionality that doesn't work.
16220,Great online learning app
16221,Awesme!!! Helpful
16222,"Error(-1,1004) please fix I can't watch the videos."
16223,"I was very enthusiastic with this, as I spend a lot of time commuting to work and back, but I get an error whenever i try to play a video lecture (1, -1004), thus making this app unusable :("
16224,Cannot play video on my Huwaei mobile phone.
16225,It use to work but I can't watch or download anything on my s5 anymore
16226,"Worthless if videos don't work.  Can watch fine on website, not sure what the problem with this app is."
16227,But I can't watch any lectures.
16228,I woulf highly recomend it to those who follow their corriousity
16229,The app constantly shows toolbar to install Coursera app from Google play on Android 4.4.4. The layout often breaks and switches to PC version of the website.  And please add video saving to SD card.
16230,An amazing App
16231,Cool ap
16232,great one....very useful..
16233,"I switched to official app from Coursera Companion and I'm happy about it. Soft, well looking design. Good implementation. Adequate navigation. Convenient video player. Keep it up!"
16234,"I cannot play lecture video on both my Nexus 7 and Galaxy S3. Im always on the go, need a mobile way of learning but end up not knowing how to study now..."
16235,"Was so excited about it, but I can't even download it. I have roughly 500MB available on my phone, and this app is some 8MB, but each time I try to download it, an error message pops up saying insufficient storage space.  Can someone help me on this?"
16236,Great App!
16237,"Perfect idea,  added value"
16238,"I'm glad there's an app, but in order for it to be useful it should be functional. I can't download any of the documents or open any links from the pages.  It's unorganized and needs to be more responsive.  The app need a lot of improvement because it is difficult to navigate through a course when I'm unable to open any the documents the professors provides on the pages."
16239,Move downloads to SD card & calendar integration needed
16240,Great!
16241,"There is a troublw the videos are not playing what's error (1,-22)"
16242,"To enable offline viewing, the application saves the content to internal memory. Can't move to SD card. A deal breaker. Simply unusable without this feature."
16243,Good  Arjun
16244,Great resource to expand your knowledge
16245,"It's a great app, but on lower end devices, there need to have an option to store downloaded videos onto the SD card, as lower end devices tend to have very littler internal storage space."
16246,Force closing at startup on my s4 running Cyanogenmod 10.2.1
16247,Coursera is such a great site and I love that I can keep up with things on my phone and tablet.
16248,Exllent application
16249,Since my Samsung S3 upgraded to Kit Kat the Coursera app has been shutting down intermittently causing the phone to restart
16250,Eagerly waited app
16251,superb! but might use a few improvements: speeding up videos (like on the site) for instance
16252,This is a serious bug! What's the point of downloading videos if you can't access them without internet connection?
16253,Amazing
16254,The coolest app ever..... Really... Really... Love it
16255,Nice idea
16256,Good job!
16257,Nice app ...you don't need to browse the internet to get ur video...u just get it here..bt the only thing is they should work with current courses stuff
16258,I really expect and believe that this app could give me a lot but it is showing video errors and its not playing nor online neither offline.
16259,Cool
16260,The limitation of saving videos to 'phone storage' has really irritated me. I was forced to delete all my videos as my storage space simply ran out... Better to use the desktop site and download videos directly from YouTube...
16261,Can't retrieve lost password
16262,This is the best thing for people who want to learn! I love all of the professor's who make this videos
16263,You can find a lot of courses
16264,very very useful program
16265,Videos downloaded only to device's memory? No option to move to SD card ??? Are you kidding me???  And Coursera is supposed to teach you things :)))))
16266,"All videos are downloaded to memory, not to SD card. Unsuable"
16267,Wonderful app for people looking to increase intellect by watching lectures.
16268,"Sprint Galaxy S5 - Downloaded, gives error on installation. Unknown"
16269,"I find this application very good, although having to watch the videos off my mobile phone is a bit of a bore. And the fact that I cannot copy the video files to my PC and watch them from PC it's just ridiculously absurd.  Hence why I give it 2 stars."
16270,It is missing the video markers like in video quizzes
16271,high quality courses
16272,The app is professionally developed. Good job
16273,App does not show the video on my android phone.
16274,"Lots of great subjects with great structure. Room for improvement though. Push updates for deadlines, access to forums, and alerts for responses on forums are all features I expect to be added."
16275,Allow All Applications Folder and the best Apps maximum 100%net‚Ñ¢
16276,The app is very useful..! I like it.
16277,Its perfect. 'M luvin it!
16278,"Everything you could want from online classes, minus calendar integration... And getting getting the actual credits."
16279,"Video jus goes black, only audio plays.. pls fix this...."
16280,Excellent app to further your own education.
16281,Just installed this a while ago and got to browse thru the courses list. Lots of courses from classical to futuristic. Should help me recapitulate all that I have forgotten from my college days or ones I never relished then.
16282,Nice subjects
16283,Awesome!!
16284,Proud of coursera!!  Tons of  knowledge  for free
16285,"I was looking forward to installing this application but it is a major disappointment. Videos are sound only on my phone (4.0) and they are only downloaded to a hidden folder on the phone (cannot be moved to the SD card). This, unfortunatelly, renders the application entirely useless. Hope the Coursera team will fix this soon."
16286,Cool....
16287,Says Network Error and cannot connect.
16288,Not able to download videos
16289,Absolutely fantastic. What a great way to keep your brain in shape! Can't Wait to start my new courses &lt;3
16290,One of the best apps in the Google play! And free.
16291,"I have 3 coming up and I already see issues I'm going to have...no calendar integration, no download to sd (even though I have 65gigs on the cloud/drive NOT THE POINT) please add these functions."
16292,Sth good for learning
16293,Nice app
16294,I'm a fan
16295,I love this app.
16296,"Basic things like saving courses which are coming soon, better categorization of courses etc. Will change rating upon update."
16297,
16298,Videos do not work but the courses are good you just have to use a desktop computer to look at them.
16299,Awesome learning site
16300,Thank you. Who knows who will benefit from this broad resource.
16301,hopefully get better and better
16302,Great
16303,ÿ™ŸàŸæ
16304,"No support for some things like assignments, so still need a PC for that..."
16305,But not good for more language
16306,But for one thing - no option to download lectures to external memory
16307,ŸáŸÖ ÿØÿßÿ±Ÿáÿü
16308,So stupid every time I pick a course the screen goes black
16309,ÿÆŸàÿ® ÿ®ŸàÿØÿ¥
16310,#Can't open PDF files. # app is still not completely mobile friendly. # Difficult to use discussion groups.
16311,the possibilities are infinite!!!!!
16312,Nice
16313,I get an error saying that the video can't be played or error playing video
16314,Share education. Help students and  people to grow up academically
16315,There should be forum discussions as well. PDF download of slides is absent. Otherwise gr8 app
16316,This is the best MOOC app and has the best content .  Just love it!!
16317,"It's great that you now have an app, but the lack of landscape view for videos makes it near-useless to me."
16318,Love it
16319,Very nice
16320,Excellent app landscape works fine for me the classes so far are fun and very insightful.  A calendar would be a cool addition but I can add it into my own calendar keep up the great work!
16321,This app promotes and inspires you to study and develop yourselves....
16322,Amazing app everyone should have it
16323,Its just superb app for study and growth in any type of skills.
16324,Goooooood
16325,Speechless
16326,"After I registered a course, I can't see the video tutorial, it's black screen, although I can hear the voice. Please help, thanks"
16327,A very useful feature would be to categorize courses by level
16328,I can learn anything easy!
16329,"SD Card storage was apparently not thought of during the writing of this app. Not really sure who could miss something like that with such large files! Also, turning off the screen just stops the video from playing. Have no idea why this would occur. Many videos on Coursera are just lectures and can be listened to quite effectively without having to waste power running the screen. Can't really get beyond these two incredible oversights to review any of the other apps features."
16330,Very useful
16331,Superb app n knowledgeable too!!
16332,Just like going to university!
16333,Can't thank enough!!
16334,"This app could be a hit. I have not taken a class yet, but it seems promising and could really help me out educationally, since I've just graduated from highschool and have yet to attend college."
16335,It is nice to be able to watch courses on mobile but to get there you need to login. Please tell me why are you pushing google accounts to login? It may save a precious 2 or 3 seconds to those that use Gmail addresses on coursera and annoy the hell out of everyone who doesn't
16336,On my Huawei y300 when I select the week of a course it crashes.
16337,Add more course on electronics comm...
16338,Very good app. But sound is not audible. Can increase it's sound quality.
16339,The best education app
16340,But need some quick improvement...like.. Save video to SD card... Calendar facility.. Deadline reminder for quizzes. ...
16341,"The best MOOC platform. I love it. Thank you, guys!"
16342,An app that will really help non-dumb people.
16343,Promising app!
16344,"If you seriously want to learn something, This app got all the potential to teach you."
16345,"Why error 1,.1004 is being displayed"
16346,Great finally here
16347,The future of education...
16348,Almost the same as the website....almost....
16349,Awesome app
16350,"This makes it much easier, I can download the videos and view them offline later!"
16351,Great app for learning different courses free and also it provides the video tutorials for each course. Good work guys üòäüòÄ‚ò∫üòÅ
16352,Pls where is the exact location of the files on the internal memory?
16353,Now I can finally study through my smartphone
16354,I was about to go spend a king's ransom on guitar lessons and you guys have put together such an amazing course in introductory guitar. I didn't think I would learn how to do fingerstyle so quickly but it was easy! Thanks sooo much :)
16355,Waste of time
16356,"Good app! Easy to use and even allow you to download the videos. However there are still some issues: for some course, click on the   hyperlink in course page to download materials will just lead to error, and there is no way to unenroll a course ( or at least I didn't find it )."
16357,Just a small suggestion. An option to save the downloaded video lectures to external SD card instead of internal memory would be a lot better.
16358,Thanks for the great work!
16359,Ideal app for me.
16360,Amazing app
16361,Many thanks giving iranians the opportunity to use Google play
16362,This is one of the most useful app i've ever seen.
16363,The app is decent and allows you to take the course content on the road.  Pros: - Video download for offline viewing  Wishlist: - Download slides - View videos at accelerated rate - Lock the screen while viewing videos - Ability to save downloads on SD card or external storage instead of internal storage - Option to auto advance to next option
16364,"FREE University Level Coursework, Incredible!"
16365,But its ok
16366,Even for offline studies
16367,Need to restart the app after pause because error occurs
16368,Have been waiting for this. Still waiting for Connexus.
16369,Why I can't watch or download past courses? And what about saving files to SD card? I give a 5 star if you add these functions.
16370,With this app anyone can learn anything . the app is very good just instal and become a learner till last breath.....
16371,not bad
16372,Can hear only audio no video ..pls help
16373,App won't play video lecture content. This just started 6/16/14.
16374,"Videos are running blank. Only audio is heard. Many features are missing such as 'profile', searching by dates, duration etc."
16375,Hi... I have forgetten my password... how to login to my account
16376,Job well done! No ads. No bugs. Definitely learning always on the go. Courses are really interesting and cant wait to learn more!! Keep up the good work guys!
16377,Not able to see the video. Only audio is available.
16378,Excelent
16379,Learned so much with this great app
16380,"it's a great start, but the video player is completely inoperable. keep getting the same error message and no visual."
16381,Downloaded videos don't go to the SD card or a specified location (you can't open then in your own preferred video player). The video player you have to use doesn't offer the ability to speed up the video (2x etc) so if the instructor speaks very slowly you can't speed things along.
16382,Thank you so much Coursera. This app is awesome
16383,Love it!
16384,Superb
16385,Useful and very comfortable to watch your classes lectures and exercises. Improve your knowledge with this app.
16386,
16387,"Now, i don't have to open my laptop everytime!"
16388,Simple. Seamless. Well done.
16389,Cool stuff
16390,"Its a good start but needs some work with bluetooth controls, more settings particularly where to save the vieos, and problems with video playback after turning off the screen."
16391,Awesome program!!!
16392,I haven't used the app yet but I truly love coursera and I'm really happy I can now use it on my phone so 5 stars for bringing coursera to the google store :3
16393,Where is the forum access?
16394,It works well but only deserves 5 stars if it allows to save vids to ext sd card.
16395,Best Ever!
16396,excellent
16397,Really loved it
16398,Excels in all areas
16399,One of the main advantages of coursera is being able to talk to many people in courses. On this app it was not possible to find how to connect to forums
16400,useless until fixed  .  0 stars
16401,"in my opinion, the videos need subtitles (I'm not 100% expert in English but I understand more reading than listening) there's an option to download it I know but my device doesn't open it .."
16402,Such a good app ....education for every one
16403,Just what I need
16404,"As many have voiced here, videos lectures are huge, but it appears there is no support for external sdcard."
16405,App is good. Need to have a confirm password option during sign up to avoid typo errors.
16406,"A well-designed useful and easy-to-use app, much like the website itself. It's a good start, but needs improvements such as ""Settings"", ""My Profile"" page, an autoplay option, etc. But I'm convinced these will be added with time. Terrific job guys, keep it up!"
16407,Easy to use. I love it :-)
16408,I will rate higher when auto screen rotation is enabled.
16409,I would wait for sorting out the storage issue and the forums access to give better rating.
16410,Please add the feature of downloading to SD card. When you do it I will rate the app 5 stars.
16411,Coursera continues to amaze us. Great app
16412,Lear everything for free. Great contents
16413,The best educational app all over the world
16414,Amazing App Thank you Coursera
16415,"O Coursera, al√©m de ser uma fonte inestim√°vel de conhecimento para o mundo inteiro, acertou em cheio neste aplicativo. Voc√™ pode inclusive baixar os v√≠deos (muito rapidamente) e assisti-los offline. √â Assessibilidade e Democracia de informa√ß√£o no seu sentido mais puro! Espero que n√≥s brasileiros desenvolvamos cursos como os deles."
16416,"I can't view the videos. Can u guys please fix the bug, make the videos which are universally playable"
16417,Must
16418,The downloaded videos use phone's internal memory which is quite less and not sufficient enough to have videos of even one complete course. Pls include feature of storing videos in SD card.
16419,More than Exellent .. just for addictive learner really Love it
16420,Nice
16421,The app is very good. Have been waiting for the app for long. The download videos for offline viewing is a great boon. But the video should get downloaded to SD card as internal memory is generally low. My phone has an internal memory of only 2 GB and one week's videos take about 300mb. Also the sound is also pretty low. Difficult to hear while traveling. But all in all a good app.
16422,Please let the app transfer data to sd card..........please acknowledge
16423,
16424,Great App. Excellent organisation!
16425,Can't ask for more.  Awesome.
16426,"Download starts and it pop's with error msg - ‚Äùinsufficent storage""  But My Storage space is more than 1 GB.  Kindly suggest me how to resolve this issue.  TIA  Ashok"
16427,Amazing initiative
16428,Thanks
16429,"App is not opening on my samsung tab. Many times it stops playing the videos. Pls help as i heavily rely on ""on the move mode"""
16430,"* no quizzes inside lectures  * no fast playback  * most of the pages look like the desktop version   Overall, this app offers little incentive to choose it over the desktop version on Chrome mobile."
16431,"The Coursera app is almost perfect, if it were not for this important detail:  No ability to set data (videos) to download to SD Card data.  Coursera videos being HQ and heavy on data, this represents a huge problem when device memory is limited, which is the case for the majority of users and devices.  Even tricking the Coursera app to install on the SD card does not solve the content data still being downloaded into the regular device memory."
16432,Super!
16433,
16434,ÿ¨ŸÖŸäŸÑ
16435,Wow
16436,Wonderful app for amazing learning platform
16437,I can practice my English skill with this I love this cousera &lt;3
16438,"The actual app is fairly poorly designed tho obvs coursera content is great. A lot of features like useful pdf viewing, effective downkoading and organization, organization of courses when browsing, playingvideos at x2 speed etc are missing. Hoping it is still being worked on!"
16439,Help need this app
16440,Many interesting subjects for visual learning by professional teachers.
16441,Please let downloaded media be saved in the SD card. Its not year 3000 and still our devices have very few megabytes in their internal memories. Let everybody enjoys the juice.
16442,Very good designed app but misses some important features. Option to copy or share videos with other devices and video player with speed settings
16443,This is really wonderful app. Thanks for your efforts.
16444,Cannot go to forum aswell as download material out of the software.
16445,Nicely designed and work well.
16446,A good start by coursera!
16447,The app is nearly flawless.  It just needs to integrate some important elements of the site into it. But it's understandable that all apps in the beginning are work in progress. For this reason I give it a five.
16448,Easy to manage courses. Easy to use
16449,what an amazing app nice job guys
16450,Its nice but I can't see any videos and can only hear audio.pls fix this
16451,"Links within the course won't open, for example, on clicking ""click here"" for the required readings,  nothing happens. And like has been pointed out, the app needs to let users store video in external sd card. Also, the videos should be in a standard formart playable by other video player apps as well. I'd very much appreciate if that app substituted rather than complimented the website (which is  not mobile-supported btw)."
16452,"I really enjoy Coursera and the app is a great start, but some obvious problems have not been addressed. 1. Videos should be downloaded to the SD card, as internal memory is way too small to accomodate even one course. 2. No calendar function for deadlines, etc. 3. No settings! How is that possible?"
16453,"Overall this app works really well for me, and I do recommend it as the best app out there for using Coursera on a mobile. However, when I download lectures, it saves them to the phone's internal storage, not to the much larger external card storage (which is where apps are meant to save larger amounts of data). As a result, I can only download 1-2 lectures at once before storage fills up.  Coursera developers, please fix the storage location issue! It really makes this app hard to use. Otherwise I love it!"
16454,It seems that I need special codecs for video...
16455,Nice app. Need more improvements.
16456,Either internal or external
16457,I can't get through my course on my phone because the videos won't load. That and the quiz are the only thing for my class so pretty much pointless right now
16458,I love it. Its making it easy for mr to do activities and participate.
16459,It really helps a lot :) thank you
16460,Didn't work after upgrade. I am angry because it's works very smoothly. Why are you forced upgrading?
16461,"When browsing courses, it would be nice to have a link to the full website, which has a lot more info about the course. Right now I have to share the link with Google Keep, and then click the link there to go to the website."
16462,Zakas
16463,"I'm a Coursera junkie and have been anxiously awaiting the Coursera app for Android for a long time. Now that it's here, I have mixed feelings. The app is a good start, and certainly better than nothing, but it really needs some work to reach its potential.  The good: - Lets you download videos for later offline viewing, even allowing you to ""download all"" with one tap. - Gives all the functionality of the website, with some of it offline  The bad: - The interface takes some getting used to. Pressing the device's options button does nothing. (The options menu can only be opened by selecting a button within the app interface.) - There is no way to save downloaded content to an SD card?? Wow. - No integrated calendar with quizzes, deadlines, etc. This seems like it should have been a no-brainer - NO LANDSCAPE MODE!  It's a good start. I hope that Coursera continues to bring some improvements to make the app easier to use and more powerful.  Edit: Now you only view videos. You cannot participate in required polls, take quizes, etc. 1 star."
16464,"but useless on my phone. If I download just 1 week of videos, my storage space is full. There should be an option to download videos to SD card!"
16465,"It allows viewing the courses you're enrolled in and watching and downloading all its video contents to watch it any time which is great. However, it still lacks accessing the forums and allowing homework and quizz submissions. I would give it 5 stars if it does."
16466,Very cool program. Recommend it.
16467,Good
16468,Excellent.
16469,"It is a very useful application ..  it saves time and makes me learn anywhere, anytime .. but i'm facing a serious problem in storing videos. all downloaded files use the phone storage which is usually smaller than the external storage .. and it makes the phone storage running out which causes many problems in the operating system .. ( android ) .."
16470,Why does the latest fix for videos that were not playing properly for some courses require the permission to 'Read phone call status and identity'?  Fed up with app developers who require permissions that make no sense and they don't bother to explain. This is another one of those. UPDATE: These have been added to the What's New page. Really need to go in description where they are always visible.
16471,But I don't find my stuff always
16472,"Real nice interface and no issues so far, but please add chromecast support. Would make it so much better"
16473,Really does need Chromecast support.
16474,"Only missing the option to download the course material and the possibility of playing the lectures in another player. Other than that, it's really good!"
16475,I've got error 400 on Unit 2 and now I can't reload it. cool interface
16476,Crashes sometimes. Doesn't load course text pages. Rotates screen. Not a great experience. But great concept :) Fix issues on tablets for 5 stars. EDIT: Please follow Android Design Guide and add more features.
16477,Videos are not being played . Only the vocals are being heard.  Please look into this.
16478,the download video will full if you have not much space
16479,But the app needs to be able to do a lot more to match browser experience PDF and txt download option and most importantly the ability to play video on 3rd part players pls make the needed chang
16480,"This app is great ,but I can't download or play any video in China. And it gives me this Toast message. Error(1,-1004) during playing video.  I my device is nexus5,and I have turn on ART .  Hope the coursera team could see this review, and fixed it asap."
16481,Enable downloading of pdf files too!!
16482,Great way to catch up on course content and watch videos while commuting. Unfortunately still does not have in video quizzes or access to discussion board.
16483,Great application.
16484,"Nice app in a lot of ways, but I'd like to be able to move downloaded videos to the SD card before I can give it any higher of a rating."
16485,This app would be truly amazing if only it would save off line content to a SD card.   Please fix this is you really do should get a 5 star rating.
16486,Thank you. :)
16487,Overall app quality is very good. Just one problem (I'm not sure if it is already reported): Quizzes embedded in video lectures doesn't let user answer them. Please fix it. Thanks !
16488,Awesome app...
16489,Â•ΩÂ§öËØæÁ®ãÂæàÊúâÊÑèÊÄù
16490,"It's good app, but it doesn't have function of accelerating viewing like your web-player and this is very disappointing. Also sometimes when I push button ""My Downloads"" apps is closing."
16491,"Enjoy Coursera on the computer, wish I could on android as well but no such luck (LG optimus L7 ii dual, P716). Can't play video streaming; able to download but won't play from there either. Also can't find way to send feedback of video error (fullscreen). FAQs don't open. Hope these things can be fixed soon"
16492,"Without getting into the technicalities of the app, the spirit of ""Learning on the move"" deserves 6 stars out of 5 !! Great work Coursera team."
16493,Best courses for free. Also the content of most of the courses are great. Just love the app
16494,We need to be able to move the app and its content to the SD card please. Give us this option and it is a 5 star from me. Thanks all the same for this great opportunity to get best education for free. Much greatly appreciated
16495,That is awesome!
16496,Revolutionary education app BUT I dont see why they need permission to view the identity of my phone calls.
16497,"I can't really rate it... it's too hard to use on a phone. Titles, headlines etc. are fine, but if i want to read any page with text, the font is pretty small."
16498,It eats my internal memory when downloading videos
16499,"thank you for the app,  but it is suppose that we can have access to our courses anywhere and anytime,  but some courses puts quizzes into the videos,  actually don't have access to that.  Also can't move app/content to SD card...  this two stuffs will give you 5 stars."
16500,"Wanna learn? Dont even bother, you are nobody,  it easy, no knowadge no problems."
16501,Very good
16502,"It's nice, but I can't see any of the videos. They do have sound, so I can hear them, but it's not the same."
16503,Brilliant initiative and great to see them seriously building apps for the mobile devices as well... The video streams beautifully and I can download them to watch offline.   But this app is work in progress and I think it will definitely improve in user exp.
16504,A wonderful effort
16505,I think this is the best free online lecture provider today.... keep spread knowledge to all people in the world borderless...
16506,Great resource and education at your fingertips.
16507,"It shows me error at the time of whatching any video,example:  error ( -38, 3748688) when paying etc. It would be good if the problems is resolved ."
16508,"I didnt know about this app before.If I would have known, I would have finished all my computer science courses.Great work guys.Why dont you get some award for this outstanding app . absolutely no complaints.The user can even download the courses videos for offline viewing, thats amazing too.I suggest you add more computer science/game designing/game programming videos.."
16509,This is a great app. I would only ask for Chromecast support.
16510,It simply crushes when I'm opening course materials. Very disappointed.
16511,Best
16512,Great app from great company. Thank you for your Job
16513,World class knowledge at your fingertips..!! :)
16514,Moved to a smaller phone now nothing works :( Videos do play if download fro main site though
16515,Excellent performance if you try to achieve & achieve. Abdul Malik Ghaloo Jacobabad (Sindh)
16516,Brilliant
16517,"I love this app.  The only thing it is missing is a download all button.  I'd love to choose to download the entire week or entire course if I wanted to along with just the individual videos.  If that would get added, this app would be unstoppable."
16518,Amazing
16519,Great courses
16520,I love it. I like coursera and it's apps. It is quite helpful.
16521,ÿ®ÿß ŸÖÿ≠ÿ™ŸàÿßŸáÿß€å ÿ®ÿ≥€åÿßÿ± ÿπÿßŸÑ€å ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ÿπŸÑÿßŸÇŸá ŸÖŸÜÿØÿßŸÜ ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥
16522,"For a lifelong learner like me , coursera is like oxygen to me and i am greatful to the team for this app."
16523,Where to fast forward or slow down feature
16524,Doesnt work on background so if you open another app during lecture. Bam. The app reloads and starts from the beginning. Need an update for that. Other than that the UI and design is perfect.
16525,Superb app
16526,"Still after the last update im not able to play any video through my HTC desire X with default viewer is really awful, I love coursera, I've got 3 statements of acomplishments but this is really pitty :-("
16527,Nice
16528,Makes it 100 easier to complete my classes.
16529,Works great
16530,Great app can now catch up with classes instantly
16531,"I have HTC One x, which has a built-in memory. When i download lectures from coursera it saves them in the application storage which made my phone run out of storage. Please allow me to tell the app where to store the lectures."
16532,"This is a great app. I think the design, layout and the overall content is excellent. I'm glad that many universities worldwide have taken part in making this a success. I just have one question? If I wanted to join a course but it has already started how will the grading work? Will I be deprived from a decent grade because I joined a couple week late and missed some work? When I joined Coursera, a couple of classes were already a few weeks in. Please can you help me with this issue. Thank you."
16533,"You have to go to ""My Downloads"" to access the downloads. You can not go to the course and click on a video to watch it offline. If you downloaded a whole lot of courses, the video file names may not be helpful.  Also please add speed control for the video playback speed."
16534,I really enjoy following the courses on this app. It would be perfect if I could stream the courses to my TV using chromecast!!
16535,My favorurite app
16536,App works great other than this...please fix
16537,Love this app. All the things about it is good and according to my expectations. Thank you coursera team. Keep up the nice work
16538,Very good
16539,The lack of double or 1.5 speed playback (or at least  playback with 3rd party apps) is very frustrating.
16540,"Great app, great innovation."
16541,"I am not able to view the video lectures. When I click on the play button, the audio starts playin but the video doesn't.  Please help. I am using coursera on galaxy core."
16542,"It was more configurable and thus had much less issues. Want to save videos to SD card? No problem. Want to watch video with an external player? Go on.  This one doesn't play video on good old Galaxy Tab 10.1, just black screen and sound."
16543,Noble act. Excellent source for leaning .
16544,"A very good app, but I would appreciate very much, if it was possible, that in-video quizzes also were displayed and functioning"
16545,Best app for learning
16546,Please add:  1. Video playback from same point one stopped viewing (also across devices)  2. Option to play audio track only and let it continue while switching apps and turning screen off 3. Chromecast support
16547,gr8 app
16548,Good
16549,Could benefit from Chromecast support and social login.
16550,Unstable
16551,"this app is a good start towards making the online content truly mobile. Though the app has a lot of ground to cover before receiving 5 stars. Many issues, as told by the reviewers. Dev need to work on those issues asap!"
16552,Please increase the stuffs in search engine
16553,Like offline video feature
16554,"Last two updates have been a disaster, since I am mostly mobile I can't watch videos even after downloading!"
16555,"Easy to use and lesson content awesome, learned lots. Thanks guy's"
16556,They should add in the feature of playing the lectures at 1.5 or 2 times speed which is something they have on the coursera website and appstore
16557,"I waited for this app to happen. However, the video is not playing. The audio is ok but all I see is a black screen. I downoaded the videos but they're still black. I wish i can play it in my own video player so i can adjust the video settings if it wont be fixed. In this way, I think I can adjust the video/picture manually. Thanks!  Updated and videos still not working Updated, still not working"
16558,learn on the go
16559,Must have
16560,"I'm really glad that I can now take the quiz and watch videos on the go. Offline videos and a clean design. Enhancement: I would like to swipe (left and right) in the view pager for the ""My Courses"" page, to navigate between past, current and upcoming courses."
16561,Well done (Y)  Great app!    i need agricultural & biological engineering courses.
16562,"I won't continue taking any courses here, at least through your app, because it's just giving me problems when I take a quiz, the app make me think it's done, but when I refresh or go to your web page, the quiz is like if I haven't do nothing, but of course it takes the time and the attempt. As soon as you fix this, I'll appreciate in fact"
16563,Needs option to download videos to SD. Otherwise great app.
16564,Thanks for all your deed  You creat the future by education A lot of thanks can not be. equal to your deed
16565,Grea app
16566,Thanks for providing on Android
16567,"Great app big step, however we still need to be able to store videos in SD, one course and my storage is full. Keep it up looking forward to the changes and updates"
16568,good
16569,"Free education is the most powerful thing, and this app is the key!"
16570,knowledge everywhere :) thx
16571,Excellent
16572,Great selection of courses ranging a wide array of courses worth your time.
16573,"The layout is definitely minimalist.  It makes it hard to understand where everything is.  Either I am completely missing it or the quiz and quiz info isn't included.   Both the app and site sould include tracking of where I am in a video.  I often lose my place and it is marked as watched when the video isn't complete.   Also the forum isn't included.   The app seems to be for people who use both a computer and the app so far.  It's easier than using the website on my phones browser, so three stars."
16574,This app is amazing!
16575,Despite all good design it has a very critical shortage. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MOVE THE APPLICATION TO SD CARD!!! Also it is not possible to choose the download folder for videos. This shortage makes the usability of the application highly degraded if you use it on the move frequently.
16576,Can't take the in video quizzes! Otherwise is great!
16577,"After you start a video, everything stops and you can't do anything. Had to restart the tablet."
16578,Thank you for this valuable Resources! Keep up good work!
16579,"This is a solid start, but still needs some features. Chromecast support would be great, from any platform if possible. I'd like to be able to set the app's download directory. On the 'My Courses' screen, you should be able to swipe between the three tabs."
16580,The app should record my progress through the videos or even within a video. It should resume the video from the last position I stopped watching. Like the kindle app for books.
16581,Just wow
16582,Quizes are not shown on video lectures. Also not being able to access course material (Pdfs etc...) is a major drawback.
16583,I love the download function. I was able to download a few lessons. But then my download was interrupted and now i wasn't able to resume or retry the download. It keeps telling error. Help me please. Thanks. STILL some videos cannot be played or download.
16584,"Great free e-learning app, impressive (academic) content"
16585,"I can describe this app and service by using single word ""Incredible""."
16586,4 stars just for the initiative
16587,Please provide an option to do the quiz..of the course which v have opted. Cannot move it to sd card as well .plz fix it
16588,I have 1gb of internal storage and some apps can't be moved.  Please add this feature
16589,Superb! Thanks!
16590,Good learning Improve learning methods Need to add even more subjects
16591,Thanks
16592,"Works flawlesly for me in either tablet or phone, love the fact that I can have the videos available offline!"
16593,I love coursera and its app. Almost perfect. The problem for me is the coming soon courses I can't join nor a click to be informed when the courses start.
16594,I love having this app available since I'm a continous coursera student.
16595,It took a while but now that it's here it's such a pleasure to use and pretty much flawless. Only suggestion I have is to add forward and rewind buttons in the player like the android native one has. Good job!
16596,Excellent
16597,If I could do my homework it would be better all I can do is watch videos
16598,keeps telling me network error.
16599,I am in love with coursera and now with the app it just got better.  Learning was never so much fun!  Thank you again Guys!
16600,"User friendly, extremely handy, gave a totally new use for my tablet. Opening of video segments is fast with download possibilities."
16601,Course pages often do not work. Videos are stopped if you block the screen. Navigation is not great. Downloaded videos are stored on ROM and can't be moved to SD card.
16602,Pretty Good
16603,Wow
16604,Awesome app for free education.
16605,Finally it comes to the app version. Love it!
16606,Suits my requirement!
16607,"I use a samsung galaxy s duos(GT-S7562).Whenever I start a video,I  only hear the audio and the screen remains black.Please fix this issue.I really want to reap the benefits of having a coursera app."
16608,Course catalog not useful as it's not possibile to filter by language. Playback speed cannot be increased.
16609,The next revolution in open education
16610,Pls add support for lecture videos download to sd card without this mobile learning will be limited
16611,It is great that Coursera is providing free education and now an free app to view the courses. But I feel like a few more features can really improve the apps usability.  Features like:  Resuming  a video even after you quit the app or press back (Or allow 3rd party video player like VLC) Changing the playback speed of the video (Or allow 3rd party video player like VLC) Switching Languages In Video Quizzes Chromecast (maybe?)  But overall this is still a great app! Keep up the good work!
16612,Exceptional
16613,"Great app! I really love the fact that i'm able to download it on my device and view it anywhere I want. But the only down side is, I can't extract the downloaded file from my device. Mainly because I can't locate where they're stored. It would be helpful if I can set the download directory to my SD card instead of internal memory. I only have 8GB internal memory on my tablet...."
16614,Overall this app is great. It has all the essential features. I'd love if there was an option to speed up or slow down the videos though.
16615,what you need to keep your Brain from Rusting
16616,Great way to learn and gain knowledge
16617,
16618,Superb
16619,Coursera is the best MOOC I have ever seen! Congrats!
16620,Was waiting for the mobile application. Thanks
16621,Best app...
16622,I have been waiting for an android app from cousera and I must say am more than impressed on this app. The user interface is very neat and lovely. This app deserves more than 5 stars. More greese to your elbow guys. Awesome app.
16623,Great!
16624,'nuff said
16625,Applicazione ben fatta. Bella la grafica e molto intuitiva. Infinit√† di corsi disponibili consultabili sia da web che da mobile
16626,"Can't move or save videos to SD card so really annoying, par from that amazing app."
16627,"There is nothing to fault. Simply flawless! From the app itself to its layout, and that's not saying anything about the idea. Totally recommended for all with an urge to learn and muster more knowledge."
16628,It is an excellent app. I wish i access much more courses via coursera
16629,I didn't found how to download lectures on SD card. All other stuff is excelent.
16630,I think Coursera is one of the best projects on the WWW. And they're welcome to Android.
16631,The best app in my phone
16632,Simple and to the point. It works.
16633,"The screen goes black and I am not able to see the video while the audio is still playing in the background and video the controls are visible. Also, I am not able to participate in any peer assignment from the app as the option to open any peer assignment is greyed out and seems to be unclickable."
16634,Please implement the video cache to save the videos automatically without having to mark for download. The OS cache will handle the memory
16635,"Thankfully I can download videos, but while attempting to stream it the video parameters seem to be too large for the screen without any option for full screen. Either way, after downloading it the video works fine."
16636,I love the fact how the app runs so smoothly and the video player runs without any problems. That's something I always look for in an application. Good job you guys and girls.
16637,Excellent free service
16638,Cf Cf Cf cf Milo
16639,Thanks Coursera
16640,Cant move to my SD card :'(
16641,Awesome app that follows Google Design Guideline
16642,Waited a long time for this app and it did not disappoint!
16643,Cannot choose Offline save location
16644,Download not working
16645,Totally love it! Now I can even do a bit if study in the bus to work!
16646,I vividly recall that awesome moment when I was handed my Coursera Certificate of Accomplishment. To me it was inspiring. To now know that I can equally learn through my mobile device via this wonderful app is overtly inspiring. Thanks to the Coursera Team.
16647,"It's interface is clean and I love it,but in the videos i get only sound and subs,no image playback,just blackness.i don't know if i did anything but since i'm not sure I'll rate it 3 stars,hope you guys fix it if it's a thing"
16648,Awesome 1 for free n top courses
16649,Very nicely done
16650,The app just stopped running and a window persisted to a point of disabling my phone. I Uninstalled it for now.
16651,"Started Using this program in 9th grade and still, one of the best things that has ever happened."
16652,Thanx keep going
16653,Beautifully designed respecting android patterns. Fully functional and really fast!! Smooth job!   Thank you very much! I was waiting for this!
16654,GREAT!!!
16655,very good
16656,Excellent app
16657,Add an explanation for each permission. Why do you need it and what do you do with it. It's just fair and transparent for the users.
16658,I have 400 mb of phone storage in which stock apps are stored and 16 GB of SD storage. The app stores video on my phone storage and that's why I can download hardly one video. Please add option to chose custom download folder thanks.
16659,A heaven for those who believe in knowledge and the power of education. It's like a blessing which deemed upon us in this internet age due to tremendous connectivity. I hope as many people join this and keep learning more.
16660,Will be better if there's no error during playing video
16661,Great!
16662,Why on earth coursera needs phone call access?
16663,Good apps ever!
16664,"Loving the app, you are even  able to watch the videos on there and they kept track from where i had leftoff on PC. I didnt see of tests were working but i give it a 4* for conveniance."
16665,"Searching ""project management"" leads to totally unrelated topics and even just ""project"" leads to unrelated course which does not even have the word project in any part of the close description. If by any chance you don't have this kind of course, there should not be any result."
16666,Nice to be able to take courses for free
16667,desperately need the option to move the app to the sd card
16668,"I'm glad you made a native app, but so much is yet missing from it; I'm confident it will improve with time. When playing videos, you don't have the option of changing playback speed, or putting the video in full-screen, or even positioning it so it all appears on the screen (the lefthand third of the video was off of my G2's screen)  A nice to have feature would be for the app to pop-up reminders for upcoming deadlines, and allow the user to configure the time before the deadline to receive the alerts.  All in all, I'm glad there's an app, but I found myself closing it and using Coursera in the browser."
16669,This is an excellent app which even works offline as my data connection is slow. The only issue is that this app does not provide the actual topics which will be covered in brief or rather the synopsis which gives an idea of the level of difficulty of the course in science or math. Otherwise just another milestone achieved by coursera. Brilliant app no doubt.
16670,Wish homework was visible.
16671,This app doesn't seem to allow access to forums or am I missing something? In fact functionality seems quite limited overall. Will stick with Coursera Companion until this one improves.
16672,Learn anywhere :-)
16673,I'm really happy about the app because it makes everything convenient. But please do something about video playing errors. I already tried downloading the videos but it doesn't help. You might want to just let users choose our default players whichever works best. I think that will really help. Please address this ASAP. Thanks!
16674,The best way to access knowledge from well established universities around the world. The app is also a great organisational tool for all online lectures you have subscribed to. I would definitely recommend this app to all curious geniuses out there.
16675,"This app has changed my life. Being able to seamlessly listen to lectures across devices is so simple, yet fulfilling. Not many apps can make you a better person - this one contributes to your education in a big way. Love it!!"
16676,"Hahaha, hate smelly apps that don't work from the beginning. The app got stuck at the create new account part"
16677,Works really well
16678,"It's here at last, the Coursera app for Android! I was enthusiastic at the idea of an app I could use on my tablet and downloaded it at once. But how disappointing! It's a very confused thing, totally useless..."
16679,Why Iranian students shouldn't be able to use this?
16680,I used to use coursera companion. Hope this will be better.
16681,This is one great app.. Takes the MOOC experience to a whole new level!
16682,Very optimized and efficient. Thanks!
16683,"Overall, an awesome app. I'd like to see the video speed option implemented."
16684,"Nice app, too bad its missing the forum discussions"
16685,Good but where is chromecast support
16686,I hope to get coursera android app in last sunday. but we do not see video files directly in our country because of not being fast internet connection!
16687,Being able to download content is awesome. Most importantly is that courses are free and with high level content
16688,Finally landed on Android
16689,The best learning app ever. Now on the go!
16690,"Great app - but please figure out why screen capture is disabled in video mode.  I like to capture some screens, graphs or slides for notes and this is not currently possible.  Fix for 5 stars."
16691,I missed many classes because I could not access classwork on the go. I have not tried a course on this app but this is a step in the right direction as many from developing nations will have direct access to courses that otherwise would cost much to do. Keep it up!
16692,"I was excited to find this App. Awesome app, same experience as the desktop version.   Helps me to finish my video lectures whenever I find time.  Only thing is that the videos r just downloaded in one single list.so if u've downloaded vidoes from 2 diff courses. ..there is no way u can figure out from the ""My Downloads"" list. If u guys fix that, then it wud be 7 out of 5....-)"
16693,Awesome app
16694,Doeant really have that many courses or titles :/
16695,finally for android!
16696,thank you all for making life very easy students. I'm just glad that this app is here.
16697,Im sure you will make the videos work on future updates.
16698,Really awesome app. I love being able to download the videos while I'm using wifi so that I can watch them later on the train. Wish I had this for the last course I did.
16699,"Very much useful,learn anywhere anytime"
16700,Easier to keep up with enrolled courses.
16701,"Finally the Coursera app went out to Android, I had been waiting for a while! Now I can study on the chartered bus and during the lunch time, 5(five) star!"
16702,1.Their should be an option to choose the storage of videos. All the video are downloaded and kept in internal app memory which quickly fill the phone app storage.  2. The app can also provide  an option to auto do wnload the latest videos of courses enrolled.
16703,Allows me to study on the go. Keep up the great work
16704,Superb!
16705,"Watching the videos was painful in chrome and is much nicer within this app. The experience is now missing the interactive quizzes, though."
16706,cant open
16707,User friendly and just perfect for me on the go!!!!!!!
16708,No option to transfer downloaded videos
16709,This app is excellent. The ability to download lectures and view offline is great if you want to study during a commute. I now have an extra 10 hours a week that I can spend viewing lectures.
16710,What a relief!! I haven't installed it on my phone but I'm confident it'll work. This app will surely give me the control to study anywhere! Literally!! No more excuses :'(
16711,"I was sad when they took CourseraCompanion down, but I trust this app will catch up soon. I'm particularly missing 1) play with screen off 2) save to SD 3) better organisation of weekly videos"
16712,Very fluid and easy to use UI
16713,"So far, I see the usefulness of this app; however, I can't seem to get the videos to play. Therefore, the biggest benefit that I have gained so far is to be able to read the lecture notes and keep up with the schedule. Other than the problem with the videos not playing on the app, this is a useful tool to keep up with what is going on in class."
16714,It looks great but videos can't be downloaded nor streamed in my Motorola moto g (no SD card) so it's useless.
16715,Good job!
16716,Am this App is finally available for us student to access on the go
16717,No Facebook or G+ log in
16718,And not for android 2.3?????
16719,Works perfectly on HTC Thunderbolt.
16720,"Nice app in every thing,GUI is best.."
16721,finally !
16722,Super!!!!I can learn anywhere now!
16723,I've used coursera for a few classes and they are very inciteful.
16724,been waiting this apps for long time.. finally
16725,Amazing app highly recomended
16726,Unbelievable
16727,Education is now Limitless. Thanks for this application!!!Super!
16728,This is amazing. It has a vary good chance of improving the the world.
16729,Thanks so much !!
16730,Before this app became available. I found my Coursera course extremely difficult to undertake with what I had available.  Kudos to Coursera!!!  I feel empowered to do Coursera again :D
16731,Coursera is the best! ! Thank you guys! You make world better
16732,"Nice clean design,  and makes accessing all of the course content so simple. Would be nice to be able to access the Discussions from the app as well - 5 Stars if / when access to Discussions is added."
16733,Good quality app. Exactly what I have been waiting for. Keep improving it.
16734,Waiting for this!
16735,Very good
16736,Long expected and there you are! Intuitive interface brings excellent use experiences! Bravo and gut gemacht!
16737,Please make the course readable so that some of us can also read when we do not have data to watch the videos
16738,This app has just made my life easier to get to class without using my browserüôåüôåüôå
16739,"Good to have it on android, but I can't view the video, I get error 1, 21..."
16740,I never thought something like this could ever be possible
16741,Thanks
16742,"I used to miss deadlines because watching classes was only easy if done on the computer. Now catching up on the go is easy.  My only gripe is that the app should remember the point where you last watched each video, that it support pausing and displaying the in-video quizzes, and that it remember the last video you've seen within the course."
16743,Much awaited but many improvements are required.
16744,Always wanted a Coursera app!
16745,Great!
16746,Ultimate app with a wonderful learning experience.
16747,Love the offline mode for videos.
16748,"On my device it works just fine, except of more complex tasks (the ones that need PC to complete anyway, like programming)"
16749,Thanks coursera for such a beautiful app! Clean and nice interface :)
16750,I can get access to the newest android programming courses  and other  courses for free and at any time. And the lectures were given by famous professors from famous schools. Videos are of high quality...to sum up the app is perfect coursera is perfect!
16751,"A great tool for the development of intellectual capital, the best intangible asset that mankind needs.My appreciation to Coursera and the technology service provider.Thumbs up!"
16752,Error loading vedios
16753,"Very good app for professionals, thank you very much."
16754,Thank for the free education
16755,Come on guys!! I think the android app deserves an android styling and not the progress circle from other platforms!!
16756,
16757,Coursera is awesome
16758,"Half of the video is playing off screen,  regardless of how I position my phone. If I accidentally get off the video,  I can't get it back."
16759,Age of sustainability
16760,Haven't opened the app yet but I am just glad there is one!
16761,I was eagerly waiting for this app! Good interface and simple to use!
16762,Thank u coursera
16763,Todo muy bien
16764,Look forward to trying it. Need to filter search by language and add ability to see PDF and past course results/certificate.
16765,"Coursera web was great,  and this looks even better. Excellent job by the team."
16766,I recommend it
16767,:)   :)
16768,Haven't even finished downloading as I write this. 5 stars just because I'm glad they made an app for this!
16769,Finally!! I hope the app is good. But I am just so glad Coursera is here
16770,"Thnx,  coursera, for the app, as hopefully it will make our life easier for all the students there on cousera."
16771,5 stars just for existing! Now I won't miss deadlines when away from home :)
16772,"No speed control, UI looks like 2000"
16773,Thanks for launching the app! It would be easier learning things now without missing the class :)
16774,Looks very good
16775,Useful app for all Courserians
16776,At last!!! Excellent!!!
16777,Ironic.  Coursera has had multiple classes on Android app development but it took this long for the app to get released. I'm just glad it's here!
16778,"I love coursera! This year, I'm finishing my bachelor at the University, for this reason, I can't engage any course. Nevertheless, I'll try more courses as soon as I finish my bachelor! I'm pretty happy with this app!"
16779,Very  useful
16780,"Review will Not be helpful, but just wanted to share how HAPPY I am!"
16781,Finally! !!! So  excited to have access from my phone
16782,Its only week old so expecting it will improve fast. I was looking for an option to choose a drive to save the videos.But couldn't find the option.This can be one of the places to work on.
16783,Need this so badly!!!!! Thanks a million
16784,Coursera no doubt is the best site in the world. I simply can't afford to pay myself to attend expensive MBA courses while Coursera has solve my pain and give away information for free.  Keep On!
16785,"This review is not going to be helpful. I'm just super excited to have coursera on my mobile. Personalized learning, I say."
16786,thanks a lot but please let me store lectures on sd card
16787,So excited to see coursera's app. Yet to use it though.. Will get back with the review soon..
16788,Good
16789,Very nice :)
16790,Finally coursera in my hand 24/7..
16791,Great
16792,I have trouble signing in with my coursera account. Do i have to create new account?
16793,Best online school app in the market
16794,I am going to school but sometimes I want to learn something outside of my degree. This makes it possible for free!
16795,Now in my palm thanks!
16796,Request minimum privilege
16797,
16798,Excellent app love it
16799,It would be nice if slides are available
16800,I wish if I could give 6 out of 5 to Coursera.! :D
16801,Great app
16802,The program works better than the website
16803,Have been looking forward to this app. Videos work fine but a speed up feature would be nice
16804,Pls improve more... but for now its good...
16805,"But one disadvantage of the app is that it does not allow the user to move downloaded video to sd card. I have to clear the cache to free the internal memory. So please fix it, other than it obviously great app"
16806,awww i have waited for it for ages! glad tat it is out finally:)
16807,Its a very simple minimalistic design and nice. I however think it can be better than this. Keep it up guys. :)
16808,A minimalistic UI yet incorporating all the features of the desktop version. Awesome!
16809,I just downloaded it and it looks so elegant :)
16810,I'd like to thank the developer team for such a great step in the era of mobile computing. It is very easy to use...
16811,This app is great. One thing you may improve is to correct -38 error. It happens when I trying to seek video stream. This error comes from wrong state of android media player class. I'll give you five because its free and great. Thanks
16812,Awesome
16813,
16814,"Video download works flawlessly, and you can select a sequence of lectures for download at once.  Browsing the courses from the app is also excellent - it is visually appealing, and I found it better to look for classes on the app instead of from the website."
16815,I have only used it for video lectures and course discovery. Works better than using the browser.
16816,And some profs speak slow!
16817,How can i choose to download lectures to external sd card? The lectures are eating up my internal storage right now.
16818,why is it storing vidoes on app partition rather than sd card?? its eating upp all the space! other than that its good..i'd still prefer coursera companion over this.
16819,"Can't login to my existing account. Says ""Network error.. Please check your connection."" but my connection works fine otherwise. I have reinstalled twice with no success. üò¨üò¨üò¨"
16820,"Do not click on leave session. It does not close the app, it un-enrolls you from the class you viewed last. It is too easy to make such mistake. Otherwise pretty good."
16821,Otherwise a good app. Some more features from the webpage would be nice
16822,Great apps.....
16823,"Very handy, full of useful functionality.   Would appreciate the option to filter by language (if I haven't just issued it :-) )"
16824,Great!
16825,"A great idea for those of us with an android phone, but bug filed on the tablet."
16826,"Downloaded the android app from the Coursera website but it does not play the videos, which is the main thing I wanted it for as they don't play from the website either when they have breaks in for quizzes. Changing players does not work either. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note, so not some ¬£10 piece of crap off a market stall."
16827,"It works, but missing features.   Cannot download pdf. Cannot view courses offline unless you go look for downloaded videos.  Download ed videos not organized by course. Cannot go to quiz or forum pages.."
16828,Now i can study anywhere
16829,I enjoy using this app. I can study anywhere i want to.
16830,Best
16831,Easy way to keep up with your courses
16832,I was waiting for this for a long time
16833,"I love this app,but the  downloaded videos can't move to the SD card, the APP become larger and larger,  the internal storage space of my phone run out soon, so I uninstall it!"
16834,"The video doesn't work on my RAZR D1. There is only sound when I play. Why cant we use it with our own players, and save the videos where we want?"
16835,Power is knowledge
16836,Amazing app overall but I was hoping to save the documents released by the professors as well (not only videos).
16837,"It's one of the best apps for free courses! And there are a lot of topics that I could only learn if I pay for it, so this is my favorite apps of all!!"
16838,It goes beyond bookmark replacement.
16839,Often get http 400 error
16840,I love Coursera and the app works really wellin both my phone and my tablet. One think that would make it perfect would be Chromecast support!
16841,Great
16842,Samung galaxy 2 . It keeps saying that i cant connect to the internet even though i can
16843,"It's fairly useful, but you can't access the discussions which are an important part of some courses."
16844,"The ""Download all videos"" is awesome, I can study while on the road without data conection.  This makes coursera even more awesome."
16845,Please put option to increase speed tp 2x and 1.5x. It saves a lot of time of mine.
16846,Video downloads work well but it doesn't download slides or recommended reading links
16847,I can only get audio in my phone!! :-(
16848,Could use better PDF integration directly in the app
16849,"Arise awake n not stop,coursera is here."
16850,"Quite excited, you can't find some of these courses for free. Thumps up thumps up :-) course era"
16851,I waited quite a while for this app to become avalable. Learning is at hand now. Would appreciate some enhancements like x speed for playback and option to link downloaded videos based on course...
16852,.....just awesome app..
16853,This is the best college level app i could find for course material
16854,Please show deadlines next to quizes
16855,Well done.
16856,Nice one
16857,"We get a variety of options to choose from the courses, we can enroll to many courses. This really gives great learning time !"
16858,Awesome
16859,Glad the app hit Android.
16860,ChromeCasting support would be a nice enhancement.
16861,This is the best inititave ever. Got two certificates and learnt many things. I just love Coursera.
16862,"When it comes to learning there is no other app, that helps you better than this...I just love it..."
16863,Excellent app...love it!!
16864,"There's a lack of links to lecture slides and documents that are available on the website. If that were to be included, there would be absolutely no reason to go to the website anymore and all my studying could be accomplished from within the app."
16865,doesnt have the ability to define the storage space in sd card. make me very hard to download the videos. very limited stored space in my mobile.
16866,I joined two courses they started today whats next nothing is showing
16867,"It's great to have coursera on Android!  No soft volume control in the app, no speed control like the web interface. Would be nice to have same controls as web app.  Can get into a back button loop; not sure how I got there, but killing app cleaned it up.  It would be great to get this app on ChromeCast!"
16868,"Excellent one, and I have been waiting for this for long. Would be wonderful if you can add options for (1). faster video playback, (2). in-video quiz, (3). zooming, (4). resume from last playing position, and (5). choosing storage location on sd card."
16869,Love the site... this app is really great
16870,I used to be struggling with coursera videos on my tablet. Thank you for this great app!
16871,Finally!
16872,Awesome
16873,the only thing I wish Coursera wold add is the option to watch videos in x2 or open the videos from other players
16874,I love course ra. This is so convenient for me
16875,Amazing app . Thanks . Can add new features though
16876,"Having limited internet connectivity, the fact that I need to download the course videos on my mobile and re-download them again on my PC (or even worse, stream them on demand) is very weird to me.   Otherwise the app is very good, (I wouldn't mind an option to adjust the speed of the video playback though -- I usually watch videos on 1.5x or 2x speed)."
16877,Awesome!
16878,Being a learner always  helped me keep in touch with the technology working from home. Coursera has  made it easier with this new app .
16879,Welcome to the world of open learning from world's best academicians!
16880,I can't see video during runtime only audio is working on my device Samsung s7562
16881,I was waiting for this app for last 8 months today I got this app... Thanks to coursera.....
16882,Nice app and works perfectly on my phone
16883,Great app and if you would add Chromecast support it would be Awesome!
16884,"a couple of minor tweaks would make it prefect, still 5 star though compared to a lot of other apps"
16885,When you are watching a video you cannot see the quiz in this app otherwise it would be a 5 stars application
16886,Love it
16887,This is great apart from not being able to access the in-video quizzes. I like that it lets me control downloads and see all my courses at once.
16888,"The app used to be working very well however out of sudden, it could not work with nexus 7 2013 edition , don't know what went wrong. Please help"
16889,"Good start but missing too many features. No in video quiz, can't turn in homework within app, no forum tab, etc."
16890,Totally enjoy listening to classes on the go.
16891,Would be perfect if it had the video speed controls that the web version has.
16892,Gona be the best app fr me
16893,Best app
16894,Only audio is playing during lectures with subtitles. Phone: Samsung galaxy grand quattro 18552.
16895,"This app is missing key features which were present in ""Coursera Companion"" (which Coursera has kindly forced Google to remove now that they have their own app):  * Speed up when viewing videos.  This is a deal-breaker already.  Built-in player does not offer this feature and files cannot be downloaded for offline viewing with other players. * Access to full course page.  Peer assignments, forums, special content are all completely absent.  Therefore you CANNOT KEEP UP WITH YOUR COURSES USING THIS APP ONLY.  Not only that, you wouldn't even know what you were missing.  This is a major drawback.  Absent a native interface, there should be at least some sort of in-app browser window until a next-gen interface is developed. This is an interesting beta for some future Coursera app but without the above features it is really crippled and ultimately unusable. Unfortunately, Coursera Companion managed all of the above and much more but it was unofficial and has been removed from the Play store.  If you can find an APK floating around, use that app.  This app should not have been released from beta."
16896,"I am a big fan of Coursera. Thanks for the app, been looking forward to it!"
16897,Excellent
16898,"The videos work well but it needs discussion forums, reminders for upcoming deadlines, browsing specializations and being able to take quizzes when signature track is taken. Good start, glad to use the app"
16899,Hiriyur chrtradurga karnataka
16900,Great app but can't always get videos to work. The main reason I use this app is to be able to watch the videos on my phone.
16901,Make it to save downloads into SD card not phone.  Also It would be cool if the video files had their names from course not jus like video11 which is totally means nothing. Please make  this changes. I respect you guys for the brilliant app but it needs some work on it to shine like a star
16902,Great app. great project.  However android app really lacks the speed control functionality.
16903,I downloaded lecture file in mobile but want to transfer them to lappie. But i cant find download folder for these lectures
16904,Finally this is on android awesome
16905,Needs 1.5x video speed option
16906,It's working very greatly even the network is low. Best app for the online learners....
16907,"Great app and works well. However , I never watch the videos at normal speeds and not having the ability to change the speed prevents me from using it as it takes twice as much time to go through the videos."
16908,I love coursera and this app too &lt;3
16909,This is how I am learning! !!
16910,Perfectly simple
16911,Todos deveriam ter instalado
16912,"I AM wholly unimpressed with an incomplete app! Yes, you can sign up for the courses.  I did.  Now I have to figure out other access if I want to complete the courses I signed up for!  All the other comments about sd storage would be helpful too... I've got 64 gb card waiting go be used! Let me!  Yeah,  you can watch the videos... read the comments type in the box to reply... but then you CANNOT submit!  Absolutely unacceptable... furthermore all instructions regarding tech support refer only to the I PAD iPhone app. NOT THIS ONE... Clearly not ready.  Please contact me when you fix this (galaxy note 10.1 2014)  Come on people,  impress me! I want to love this app!"
16913,Best app ever! Could be improved
16914,Excellent.  All of us should contribute to this
16915,"Good app, would love a calendar which shows you upcoming deadlines for all the courses you're enrolled in."
16916,I can hear to the audio but I there is no video visible. Please fix it as soon as possible.   Using Samsung Galaxy Win
16917,"need to add the ability to put courses on wishlist, and to [automatically] filter courses by language"
16918,Very good
16919,"Download speech is too slow in  southwestern of china and this app could not auto pause, if I leave a wifi region. I like this app, but if these problems still remain. I cannot have a well experience."
16920,"I like the convenience of the app, but it is missing two things.    1. When there is homework to be done,  you can't turn it in on the app. 2. When watching lectures, the in-video quizzes that the web application uses don't work on this app.   Otherwise,  it is a 5 - star app."
16921,User interface is easy to navigate and the app itself is very stable.
16922,Many thanks to the Android team! Would be great if we can lock the screen when playing lectures.
16923,LUV the app. If u want free education this is the app
16924,Thank you!
16925,I got it blocked at 90%that's not good
16926,It worked flawlessly before update and  now videos are not downloading.Plz fix it
16927,KUDOS!
16928,Thank you so much devloper...
16929,The best app. 10/10 would download again
16930,"Coursera is a magnificent experience, it provides a new system of MOOCs. I have been taking courses on coursera since the first days of the company. I gave you 5 stars for the love I hold to the company, but the app still needs improvements. For instance, I download videos on my P.C. and now I don't know what has been downloaded and what has not!"
16931,100% recomended
16932,"All major features including downloading lectures are here, and everything works great"
16933,"Free courses by UNAM, Slim foundation and Telmex Hub Mexican teachers."
16934,awesome app
16935,Really nice
16936,Good
16937,Takes up scarce phone space.
16938,"This app does what I have wanted since graduating college, to be able to go to college class everyday. Anyone wanting college education on a topic by taking a class on the topic, this app is for you."
16939,Phone will sleep and become unresponsive to button presses for several minutes before rebooting.
16940,"This is a great companian app to watch the videos and check for course updates, however some on the interactive features such as the autograder or interactive command prompts for classes do not work on my HTC One."
16941,"Very good application, can you please allow downloads to move into SD cards"
16942,"can't be moved to the SD card, and so it gets kind of heavy on the system memory"
16943,Great App
16944,"Not much freedom on setting in anyway ie. Data location selection,  data usage etc."
16945,Was waiting for this android version since last year.
16946,Good
16947,The mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
16948,"Apart from some glitches, overall a good app. Please add video speed options and course suggestions."
16949,There are lots of resourses in this app. It makes my dream come true that I can study robotics by myselfÔºÅ
16950,app downloads only in internal memory :( Please make option to change download folder.
16951,Excellent!
16952,Finally Its released!!!
16953,tysm developer!!
16954,Must Try for learners
16955,Can't download the course book PDF files. Without books how I can do the course?
16956,"Finally it's in android. Will be much better if (1) there's a link to course forum, (2) we can zoom/playback video in default player, (3) we can still listen to video when the screen is off. Courserans rock!"
16957,It requires much size when download any video.
16958,"Finally, the app is here. I love coursera. My horizon has expanded. 5 stars from me."
16959,Keep it up please !
16960,I love coursera! But I would love it so much more if this app supported chromecasting!
16961,"Please let the downloads to be stored in the sd card, instead of internal storage because devices with low internal storage cannot make more downloads at once, due to space limitation."
16962,1) Can't read full title for all videos  2) still needs 2√ó video speeding function or at least allow external apps to view offline videos (like vlc which allows 2x)  3) smooth experience. Nice ui. Great job!
16963,Maybe a quiz download feature that synchronizes as soon as there's a connection available would be nice
16964,Excellent one
16965,good
16966,"I believe this app delivers better UX than the web interface; unfortunately, video speed up option is missing. I hope this feature would be presented in the next version of the app."
16967,5 stars
16968,Great initiative! I have long awaited this. Thank you Coursera!
16969,"It would be nice to have an option to adjust play speed, like on the website."
16970,"For a open learning platform, Coursera deserves it"
16971,Never thought education can be mobile until this app came. Kudos!!!
16972,Best from coursera
16973,"Need to improve more options like quizzes, discussion forum and assignments, videos with low quality to download in mobile etc should be included into this app."
16974,Please can you clean up the download section and sort the videos out in their own course? It gets confusing when you have millions of videos and you dont know which video is for which course
16975,"Good fit of design to function, no crashes so far, a great service made mobile."
16976,Where to find the downloaded lectures for offline viewing on  laptop
16977,Love it.....
16978,Great!
16979,"This app is perfect for being on the go, much easier than trying to get on the website from a mobile device."
16980,"expand your horizons with this app. came to submit the review to whine about poor tablet support (no  landscape for navigation but yes for video playback ugh) , but that's fixed with latest update,  kudos and well done¬°"
16981,"It's a nice app to follow Coursera.  It needs a settings page for download location,  CC font options,  playback speed,  allowing only to listen to the videos by turning off the screen. This will probably be the main application to follow Coursera for much of us in a few years,  so it needs features on par with the web site."
16982,Great App
16983,Please add speed up for video
16984,Dissapointing...Nice and simple interface but cannot play video only audio. Also no choice of where to save downloads.
16985,Thanks  Unique problem is that application download all videos on internal memory.
16986,Exactly what I needed. Thank you!
16987,Great!  It would be perfect with Chromecast support!
16988,Â≠∏ÁîüÁ•ûÂô®
16989,"Works as advertised, but it would great to be able to read through the course forums."
16990,I deleted Facebook and installed cousera. Now when I got time go burn I learn! Such a fantastic app
16991,Great !
16992,My kind of schooling..free courses at your own pace
16993,"Still some bugs but works really well. Wish it would show more details like on main website, quiz scores for example. Video could use speed control functions as profs are too slow and time is wasted... Double speed videos please!"
16994,need a function of chosing the video download path.
16995,"This app is awesome! It has plenty of room for improvement though, mainly in the quizzes part and search filters... Also it would be nice if we could install the app in the SD memory. Looking forward to this."
16996,"Excellent! Now coursera on the go. Happy about it. For those who have a lot of travelling to do, good way to catch up on classes on coursera. Nice app. Keep up the great work"
16997,And continually improving.
16998,Coursera is on Android!!
16999,I don't see the in video questions but other  than that its a good app.
17000,
17001,It is working very good with me & no problem at all  but really we need to be able to choose where to download courses bcz most of our mobile phones internal memory are very small
17002,It is a good start.  I would love for it to synchronise with the online part so I can see which video was already watched.  Needs forum integration and ideally writing peer assessment. Definitely let me do the grading.
17003,Awesome to be able to learn like this
17004,I have been waiting for this app  ***** ((5stars))
17005,Glad to have possibility to use my android TV set for education from coursera
17006,Learn when ever you want n where ever you want... Amazing App
17007,Love this app!
17008,It would be useful to be able to turn off the screen while continue listening to the courses.  Thanks
17009,Cannot download video to SD card
17010,More than worth it!!!
17011,Amazing app. Kindly ensure downloaded videos play in offline mode.
17012,"Love it, hope you become better!"
17013,"I have just found that the andriod app has used 189 Mb of mobile data (despite having Restrict background data selected).  I'm not clever enough to know whether this is an issue with the Android 4.3 version running on my Galaxy S3, or whether it is an issue with the Coursera app - but it is obviously fairly frustrating (we have really tight restrictions on expensive bandwidth in my country).  A couple of other issues I have found: - some of the lecturers are very quiet - which even with ""speaker boosting utilities"" - are really hard to hear (I try and listen while commuting, but this is not possible with the current combination of application, lecturer sound levels and my previously undiagnosed hearing loss). - videos don't resume at the point you pause them if you switch away.   - you can't zoom into the video (if, for instance, there is a diagram being shown that has detail you need to read). - logging a support call for the Android app  20 minutes of searching - without success.  I am assuming that is my issue rather than the application.  Like many others, I have been waiting for this app for a long time, but the data usage and sound are key issues for me."
17014,"Keeps freezing my phone up. Uninstalled. Too bad, I like the concept."
17015,The new update sucks!! Now I'm not able to stream any video for online viewing and an having to download every single video for offline viewing. Fix this quickly coursera
17016,Thank you coursera team for this app on Android phones and tablets. My long wait is over now. Would love to see the landscape mode for the phones as well. Can you guys also enable pinch zoom? Am I asking too much! I know you guys working very hard for us to have a fun learning experience. Couserans rock!
17017,need Chromecast support
17018,Great app!
17019,"I don't get the landscape mode on my tablet, but apart from that, its a wonderful app. Does exactly what it says it does"
17020,"Love the app, I have expiericed no issues as of yet :)"
17021,Errors all the time :(
17022,Wow long live ICT
17023,Excellenct
17024,"Awesome app, learn anywhere anytime."
17025,Very nice now!
17026,Really helpful
17027,Coursera is excellent and the app is good
17028,"Easy to use, really like it!"
17029,Thank you for the app. This is very much needed for the complete learning experience.  I wish if  the app remembers my progress across devices; including the video location.  Sometimes I switch to laptop or iPad and I've to remember the location where I left off.
17030,Invaluable. Use it every day on a nexus 7 tablet and motox phone.
17031,100 %
17032,"It is a great app, but needs to support landscape mode"
17033,"Perfect, does as expected. Maybe add feature to listen to the videos' audio channel with screen switched off, and download scheduling (when network is available / when course opens). Thx!"
17034,But causing error while playing downloaded videos please change it
17035,Makes access to nerddom very efficient!
17036,How could you not love the website and the intent of this whole idea. One really annoying but minor let down is the fixed Portrait orientation of the app... surely/hopefully this is an easy fix???
17037,I will wait for the catalogue of courses to improve.
17038,You guys need to contact the writer of √ßoursera on the go. he knew what we needed in an app. I love coursera  on the go. Can't cope with yours.
17039,Great app
17040,"Please, this is only on v. 1.0.2, so it must be full of bugs and such. But that aside, I have benefit so much from this little app. It allows me to download them via wifi at home, and then listen to them during my lunch break at work, so I can catch up on some of the videos.  That being said, I would like to see one feature, to be able to move the videos to other locations, aka SD card. I mean, my phone only has 16G, with the system holding roughly 6G+, I don't really have that much left for all the videos that I am going through. With this option available, I would be one HAPPY guy, able to catch up when I can't get on the web, especially on the plane."
17041,Increase play rate button needed
17042,E learning becomes mobile and smart
17043,You are getting two stars for some issues related to your app.  First is that the app crashes a lot. Also is a feature you should do. Chromecast should be supported.  Otherwise I love your app. When these issues are addressed the star value will be increased. Do you have any need for Glass developers?  Wearable tech like Google Glass would be perfect for this. The videos would work well in a pinch.
17044,Greatest app for lifelong learners.
17045,Ok
17046,Coursera app for Android is great! Now I can do my homework even without my laptop.
17047,Awesome
17048,"But too bad, it couldn't be moved to sd card"
17049,Been waiting for this a long time. Great work with the app. Gonna try it out.
17050,I am very happy that coursera is available on play store. Thank u coursera...!!!
17051,"I was using the Coursera On The Go Free. Somehow, this app was discontinued. There are some feartures from this app that was very useful and it is not present in this app: 1. Ability to view the PDF files. - lecture slides. 2. Option to use internal or external video player 3. Information where the lectures are stored. Or the Cache directory  The app needs improvement"
17052,I had been waiting for such an App. Honestly I envied guys with apple iPhone getting the luxury to this app. Thanks for making us believe that android too has the hang over Coursera.
17053,Great to learn on the go
17054,"Just perfect, makes learning easy & life productive. Thanks Coursera!"
17055,Helps u learn more on ur favorite topics
17056,"The myth that you need to spend thousands of dollars for a decent education is no more with the announcement of Coursera, and now it's even easier with Coursera Mobile :)"
17057,can we have the option to move the app to sd card?
17058,I love this application.
17059,Thank you for this amazing app  that I was waiting for
17060,Great app.
17061,Finally! On Android!
17062,Just say YES!!!!
17063,On Android
17064,"It makes researching, and learning something new very easy by puttuig it all in one place, Love the concept..keep it up :D"
17065,This is a ambitious project. Really appreciate for the app and i am confident coursera will bring revolution in education and develop new knowledge age. Make the world go further.
17066,Really like this
17067,Reshaping the future of learning
17068,"High quality content,  High quality teachers,  High quality app,  Oh and the courses are FREE"
17069,Should add the ability to store videos on SD card rather than internal memory.
17070,Coursera on android is probably the best thing to happen to android.... and coursera
17071,Like it but 2 things I wish it would do is handle a landscape mode and also working with Chromecast. Love the fact that I can download the videos for watching them when I don't have an actual connection!
17072,The fact that Coursera is  now on android is alone enough to make me feel wow. Now I can learn on go !! wooohoo
17073,App is still missing a lot of feature but it is a good start.
17074,Can't use it on the phone otherwise :(
17075,"Ive been waiting for this app in google play for so long, and I have to tell you guys this app is amazing. Hope it will get better and better."
17076,"the concept of offering free classes to people is awesome. if you are preparing for college, furthering your studies, or if you just randomly want to learn something new, this is a great tool to use. i rated it 4 stars only because there is no tablet/landscape mode."
17077,Google+ integration.
17078,Absolutely love coursera
17079,"I love it , used it before. and now on android just awesome"
17080,"The application is well designed, it covers some of my academic subjects. So once again , thanks :-)  STUDENTS MUST USE THIS APP"
17081,No fixes still can only hear the audio
17082,Thanks coursera.
17083,i love it.. its long time i was waiting for it..:)
17084,It feels great to see this site over android version. There is long way to go for improving it. It should include download option for SDK card too. Forums are missing. Home page and discussions are also missing and documents are not getting downloaded too. I hope future updated options will solve these problems.
17085,"Knowledge is Power! Coursera, Thank you for providing unlimited power to the future!"
17086,Should add the ability to store videos on SD card rather than internal memory. Takes up all my space. 5 stars after it is done. Otherwise simply gr8
17087,Can't download videos on SD-card.
17088,Sorely missing out on the speed controls on the videos.
17089,It's a long time I am looking for something like this.
17090,Works wonderfully but would appreciate if there were more advanced filtering options and speed control option on tutorial videos.
17091,Great app. So far having a good experience with it
17092,"Very nice adition, please add the faster video playing option"
17093,Great job.
17094,Been waiting for n official app for a long time
17095,The best app I ever seen!
17096,The amazing app that can learn high-quality course from your pad.
17097,"Thank You Coursera, Thank You Coursera, Thank You Coursera"
17098,Not able to browse the course section.  Else content is good...  Plz develop....
17099,Having enrolled in the upcoming Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures course I know that there are video lectures that the professor has asked us to preview. Yet they don't appear to be available in the app.
17100,Great platform for learning
17101,"I cannot sign-in using my coursera username and password. It gives me the message ""Network error. Please check your internet connection..."" And I tried to access other apps on my phone. The connection is fine. I can sign-in to coursera on my PC though. Please help."
17102,Allows me to watch video lectures while on the move. Very useful.
17103,Please add the ability to do in video quizzes and ill rate a perfect 5 stars.
17104,"Waiting so long for this, you should all definitely install this app ;)"
17105,App is perfect for watching lectures on the go so you can stay up to date with your courses during a busy day.
17106,Learning is the essence of life.  Coursera is the best thing to happen to education in ages
17107,Very good
17108,Good apps
17109,Pretty app thanx
17110,Getting only audio and subtitle after selecting any video in the app..pls fix this bug
17111,"My only complaint is the lack of sorting of downloaded offline files. If I download all videos in a course, they're in my downloads in reverse chronological order, which is a bit annoying. And if downloading from multiple courses, there's no order at all. This one feature would make the app just about perfect in my book."
17112,Videos r nt wrkng here
17113,‡§¨‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü
17114,"I love it, but it doesn't have prerequisites, which can be annoying when signing up for new classes. Please add this."
17115,I have been waiting for this for a long time! !! Thank you !
17116,High quality video. Organized well.
17117,Unable to create an account keeps showing error day 3 unable to create an account unistalled app fix this problem please. ..
17118,"1. Could we play the video at 1.5x or 2x speed? Or, we could allow the use of external video players. I think it's very important to speed up the video for online courses.  2. Could we also indicate whether this video has been watched, not only in each video titles, but also on the week titles?  Shawn"
17119,"A great endeavour.  Truly culmination of a great thoughts put together with a vision to make access to education ""free"".."
17120,Hats off work guyz
17121,App is great but where are the downloaded lectures saved ? I want to transfer them to my laptop.
17122,Could use Chromecast support
17123,"Simply an excellent app, have no words to describe. SUPERB"
17124,Finally thanks coursera!!!!
17125,"...but, it does need to have landscape mode for tablets and videos that play correctly. It also needs settings availability for night mode, font size modification, etc."
17126,"just what I needed, a bit late"
17127,very nice..its too gud too useful..:)
17128,In Samsung Galaxy S2 sign in button is dissabled or at least does not work
17129,Very useful courses and a very good interface
17130,"Very nice app, I wish it had a calendar view for your current courses. Other than that it's perfect!"
17131,Awesome app for learning thx
17132,"Nice APP but if you are short on disk space, download the videos is a no-go. Hope future versions allow to move to SD. An agenda sync option cames in handy too."
17133,"Overall, the app works great for the features that they have implemented. It is missing a few features cause me to use the website more than I wish was necessary; however, I am glad they have made a somewhat limited yet stable rather than putting in a dozen broken features. I do wish it supported landscape mode in several views which shouldn't be hard to implement."
17134,The app doesn't work in landscape so on a tablet it's really not much more than annoying to use. Other than that it seems OK but I'll only use it if the update supports landscape.
17135,Needs chromacast support for Lecture Videos!!
17136,It is a pleasure to be able to catch up all my courses easily in the public transports every day. I was really looking forward to it!
17137,"I was waiting an official app! Awesome, no bugs until now, let's see how this app behave.."
17138,\o/
17139,It's amazing.
17140,Works really well. Chromecast support would be an amazing addition.
17141,The app is just great! Now its easy to learn anywhere and at any time.
17142,Amazing!
17143,chromecast support would be a great addon
17144,I've been using this since beta and its been great.  Few minor bugs here and there but... At this stage it is expected. All in all I was able to watch my lectures with better ease than going through the website on my phone.
17145,Yipee I was waiting for this for months
17146,and free... Kudos!
17147,Just started using it today and it works well so far. Chromecast support is a must. That will help with my signature track video lectures.
17148,Ë∞¢Ë∞¢Êèê‰æõËøô‰πàÂ•ΩÁöÑÂ∫îÁî®Ôºå‰∏≠ÂõΩÁöÑÂ∞è‰ºô‰º¥‰ª¨Âä†QÁæ§103368175
17149,Thanks Coursera
17150,We need an upgrage but AWESOME
17151,I was expecting actual courses. These are all generic vague courses.
17152,"The very idea of coursera itself is fantastic and the website is excellent. But this app takes the accessibility to another level.  Even though it says 'designed for phones', or works beautifully on my nexus 7.   Thank you Andrew Ng & team."
17153,nice one
17154,Google calendar
17155,It would be better if the events can be integrated into my Google Calendar.
17156,Implement google+ sign in! I hate signing in manually.
17157,Great.
17158,"Works great and I am able to watch videos in full screen and rotate my mobile device, so I do not understand the problem others are having. Please design for tablets also"
17159,"Everyone can find something to learn from here, for free!"
17160,"Great app finally released. For the people who are finding bugs or have problems with the app, simply shake your device and a prompt will show up to send feedback. Please do, because that's an efficient way to let them know things that need fixing."
17161,Excellent
17162,Giving 5 stars till after my evaluation lol.
17163,Finally for andoid! Shoulda done the android app 1st before lame a$$ apple... but at least its here.
17164,Very neat and efficiently designed app . congratulations on a work well done
17165,Killer app
17166,"This is a comprehensive app, and the ability to download content is fabulous. However, still a little glitchy and slow to load. Also the navigation can be tricky when going between menus. Overall it is nice to have and I look forward to future updates!"
17167,Chromcast support needed!
17168,"Works great on my Galaxy S3 :-) , but not my TF700t tablet :-("
17169,Education on the go!
17170,Simple and easy to use.
17171,Great app!
17172,Thanks
17173,Awesome. Please add chromecast support. I know there is another app that does it out there.
17174,It took a long time to be available for Android but it's awesome. UI problem: the top right menu button goes half beyond the screen.
17175,"it works very well, I gave 4 star because it's missing in-video quizzes and I think the first update should focus on this."
17176,Can't wait till classes start!
17177,I can do my home work early...
17178,Great way to study on the go. One thing that I can't do is evaluating peers. Specifically for the Programming Mobile Apps for Android Handheld Systems course where I have to evaluate other students. There is no way to do it using the app.
17179,Excellent
17180,Thank you for get coursera on the android
17181,Good app..
17182,Been waiting for this in a long time
17183,"I would like to see a more diverse learning environment in which more liberal arts courses are offered to balance those of science, technology, and business."
17184,Attended Berklee music for free
17185,"can't see any video, plz fix it gives some error(1,‚Äì214.....)"
17186,Was waiting for the app from a long time...Thanks a lot team :)
17187,Its free... üòÄ
17188,Love it!
17189,Awesome!
17190,Finally on Android :)
17191,This is a wonderful app with nice concepts. All my best wishes to devs for future projects.
17192,You did want we asked. Great!
17193,finally
17194,Great and useful app!
17195,Thanks.
17196,"Courses on a wide variety of topics. Could make one very educated, if used on a daily basis."
17197,I like it.
17198,Coursera app is the greatest app for me.  Learning on the go.
17199,It looks clean and I have been waiting for it. But why is it only designed for phones?  I can't even rotate my screen. Please fix this in the near future.
17200,Waiting for this app for a long time.
17201,The great Coursers is now on mobile. I am glad !!!
17202,Finally an app! Definitely needs a lot of upgrades and enhancement... Hangs in between... Still will mostly stick to desktop
17203,Sometimes the app is very unresponsive and simply hangs. Also has some resolution compatibility problems. Sometimes it opens desktop version of the page.
17204,"Go, Google!"
17205,Love it
17206,I am glad that they came up with this app. I always find myself too busy. With this app now I can learn my courses while in commute and so on.
17207,"The current app is useful but 'breaks' usability by forcing me (on a Nexus 7 2012 edition) to use it in portrait mode. At times, I hold my tablet in inverted portrait mode (e.g. during charging so I don't bend the cable) and to suddenly be forced to change the way I hold the device just because I use the Coursera app is irritating.  Ditto when switching between watching a video and the app. Having to constantly turn the tablet between portrait and landscape mode is bad user interaction. The video should be playable in portrait (and inverted portrait) mode.   The app should offer portrait, inverted portrait and landscape modes so that users don't have keep turning their device to use the app."
17208,"HI, Others have also brought up this issue. The videos cannot be watched on tablets.   This application seems to download and store in internal storage, which is very inconvenient, and not accessible to other players which provides higher level of flexibility for playback during offline mode.   I usually download all videos and transfer to tablets and watch while commuting to office n back. The process of having to transfer is what I expected to reduce, but it did not happen."
17209,"Now. I can learn on the go.  I have a 3hr daily commute, all can be put to good use."
17210,"Finally, the official coursera app."
17211,It is early days...am very happy
17212,Works perfectly for me! Also it has a lean and beautiful layout + all the contents. Great job!
17213,Thanks for this. About time Android users got access.
17214,And nice idea but there is a very prominent disadvantage you can't watch videos in full screen and rotate the screen..
17215,Still need lot of improvement
17216,Doesn't allow the audio/video to run in the background.
17217,Waited so long for this app.....
17218,"Fast, clean UI"
17219,"can not login using this app, keeps showing ""network error, please check your internet connection"". I am using internet over bluerooth."
17220,"This app is  a must for all those who likes to learn. UI is nicely designed, love it more than the web version."
17221,This is exactly what I imagined the Coursera android app would be!
17222,Please add chromecast support
17223,Great app for great service!
17224,"I love it but the video lectures play audio only, makes the app quite useless"
17225,Thanks for catering to Android users too!
17226,Thank you for releasing Android application. Works great.
17227,Simple UI Good work team cousera!
17228,Minimalistic and easy to use! Great companion app for portable learning. I'd appreciate having the fast forward option for video play through similar to the website though.
17229,Really friendly and wonderful app.
17230,Now I can make take classes wherever I go.
17231,"Beautiful design, clean, easy to use. Take the learning anywhere."
17232,Was waiting for this one for long..  Please add immersive mode for video playback.
17233,As good as the last one with a better user interface
17234,Clean design and very easy to use. Great job team!
17235,Great app. It doesn't crash and the download manager seems to have all the features I want.
17236,"Thank you, I have been anticipating Coursera for Android!! This mobile app has sweet features. I can now watch videos and learn any place, any time!"
17237,I can finally take courses on the go! This app has an amazing user interface and design!
17238,Very easy to use
